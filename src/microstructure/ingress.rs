//! The deterministic **ingress-reorder buffer** — the live gateway-edge
//! application of the seeded [`LatencyOffset`](crate::microstructure::LatencyOffset)
//! ([03 §6.1](../../../docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md#61-deterministic-ingress-ordering),
//! [05 §3](../../../docs/05-microstructure-config.md#3-latency-injection)).
//!
//! #45 landed the seeded per-`(session_id, msg_seq)` latency draw; this module
//! lands the mechanism that **consumes** it — a bounded, deadline-ordered arrival
//! buffer that sits **before the sequencer** and reshapes the order in which client
//! order-entry commands reach the single-writer actor. A slow client (a large drawn
//! offset) loses the queue race to a later-arriving fast one, exactly the failure
//! mode real venues only exhibit under load.
//!
//! ## Where determinism and replay come from
//!
//! The reorder is a **live ingress transformation**. The per-underlying actor
//! assigns `underlying_sequence` in the order it **receives** commands (post-reorder)
//! and the journal records **that** order. On replay the journal is replayed in
//! `underlying_sequence` order — the reorder is **not** re-run — so replay
//! determinism is automatic (replay uses the journaled post-reorder order). The
//! obligation this module carries is narrower: the **live** reorder is a pure
//! function of its seeded inputs **under a controlled clock and a serialized
//! admission order**, so that the *same run seed, config, and input command stream*
//! yield the *same reorder* and thus the *same journal*. The ordering **rule** never
//! calls `SystemTime` directly:
//!
//! - a command's release **deadline** is `venue_now_at_arrival + LatencyOffset` —
//!   the **venue clock** read at admission plus the #45 seeded draw (never a fresh
//!   RNG here), in microseconds ([`release_deadline_us`]). Under a stepped/seeded
//!   clock that `venue_now` is itself deterministic; under a **realtime** clock it
//!   is wall-fed, so the deadline *value* is wall-influenced and live run-to-run
//!   reproducibility is **not** claimed there (replay stays deterministic
//!   regardless — see below);
//! - commands release in **deadline order**, and an equal-deadline tie breaks on
//!   `(session_id, arrival_sequence)` — a monotonic per-arrival counter, never a
//!   hash-map order or task-scheduling order in the **key** ([`ReleaseKey`]). The
//!   `arrival_sequence` *value* is assigned by the admission-race counter, so under
//!   genuinely concurrent admission two equal-`(deadline, session)` commands take
//!   their relative order from that race — the same off-oracle class as a plain-FIFO
//!   mailbox arrival race, and equally baked into the journal once assigned.
//!
//! ## The release horizon (why we never release too early)
//!
//! An entry is releasable once the venue clock has **strictly passed** its deadline
//! (`now_us > deadline_us`, [`IngressReorderBuffer::drain_below`]). This strict
//! comparison **is** the release horizon: latency offsets are non-negative and the
//! venue clock is monotonic, so any command that has **not yet been admitted** will
//! be admitted at a venue instant `≥ now` and thus carry a deadline `≥ now >
//! deadline_us` of anything we release. So — modulo the small admission window
//! between reading the clock (fixing the deadline) and inserting into the buffer,
//! which only matters under genuinely concurrent admission — every command whose key
//! is `≤ (D, session, seq)` has already been admitted when we release deadline `D`,
//! and draining `deadline < now_us` in key order reproduces the global total order.
//! No separate horizon parameter is needed; it falls out of the invariant. The
//! ordering **rule** is identical under all three clock modes (order by the virtual
//! deadline; only *when* the clock passes it differs). The resulting live global
//! order is run-to-run reproducible under a **controlled clock with serialized
//! admission**; under a realtime clock or concurrent admission it is best-effort and
//! only **replay** is guaranteed — which is the load-bearing property, since the
//! journal records whatever order the live run produced.
//!
//! ## Bounded (a DoS control)
//!
//! Two independent bounds keep a hostile input from growing the buffer without
//! limit ([08 §5](../../../docs/08-threat-model.md#5-resource-exhaustion)): the
//! drawn offset is **clamped** to [`MAX_INGRESS_OFFSET_US`] before it becomes a
//! deadline (a `u64::MAX` offset cannot hold a command forever — it releases within
//! the horizon), and the buffer **depth** is capped ([`IngressReorderBuffer::insert`]
//! returns [`IngressBufferFull`] at capacity, a documented typed drop rather than
//! unbounded growth). Both bounds are deterministic — the same flood is dropped at
//! the same point every run.
