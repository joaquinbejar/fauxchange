//! Application layer: the bounded **seeding phase** (#024) — the startup window in
//! which the venue applies a [`crate::config::SeedManifest`] to a
//! freshly-assembled [`AppState`] in a **fixed manifest order**, *before* it flips
//! to serving ([06 §7](../docs/06-deployment.md#7-seed-data-and-scenarios),
//! [03 §10](../docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md#10-state-changing-operation-classification)).
//!
//! ## What the phase applies, and through which wired paths
//!
//! The seed manifest is validated at **load** (in [`crate::config`]); this module
//! is the *application* half. In fixed manifest order it:
//!
//! 1. applies the default market-maker **persona** knobs to the engine
//!    ([`MarketMakerEngine`](crate::market_maker::MarketMakerEngine));
//! 2. **provisions accounts** idempotently into the [`AccountRegistry`] (#012),
//!    hashing each FIX password with Argon2id and dropping the plaintext;
//! 3. **registers each contract** with the market maker (persona quoting);
//! 4. sets each underlying's **opening price** through the price seam
//!    ([`PriceSimulator::set_price`](crate::simulation::PriceSimulator::set_price),
//!    #016) — a journaled [`SimStep`](crate::exchange::VenueCommand::SimStep) plus
//!    the market maker's requote, whose `AddOrder`s **vivify** the leaf books onto
//!    the shared symbol index; then
//! 5. **settles** — a bounded wait for the off-thread requote forwarders to vivify
//!    the full chain, so the hierarchy is present before the caller flips to
//!    serving with [`AppState::begin_serving`].
//!
//! ## Population path is honest about the seam (no fabricated hierarchy-create)
//!
//! The inherited REST hierarchy-create routes (`POST /api/v1/underlyings/…`) are
//! **stubs** that refuse (manifest input): there is no sequenced hierarchy-CRUD
//! command upstream, and a leaf book only exists once an order **vivifies** it
//! (`get_or_create_*`). So the instrument set is *not* populated by REST create
//! calls — it is established by the persona registration + the opening-price seed,
//! whose market-maker quotes vivify the leaves through the **sequenced order
//! path**. This is the honest, wired population path; it is journaled and
//! replayable, and it never touches a book directly.
//!
//! ## Determinism ([02 §5.2](../docs/02-matching-architecture.md#5-determinism))
//!
//! Every step iterates the manifest in the fixed sorted order the resolved
//! [`crate::config::SeedManifest`] already fixes (sorted underlyings
//! → sorted expirations → sorted strikes → `call, put`), and the market maker's
//! requote-command forwarder is a single ordered task, so the vivification ids are
//! a reproducible function of the manifest. The settle is a bounded *completeness*
//! wait; it does not change the order.
//!
//! ## Idempotent re-seed
//!
//! Re-applying the same manifest is a no-op: [`register_instrument`] is idempotent
//! per symbol, [`set_price`] re-sets the same opening price, and
//! [`provision_seed_accounts`] treats an account already present at the **same**
//! shape (permissions + FIX username) as a no-op. A **conflicting** re-seed is a
//! typed error — a different opening price for an already-seeded underlying, or an
//! account id re-provisioned with different permissions.
//!
//! ## Seed vs recover — the recovered underlying still quotes (#85 / #148)
//!
//! A **recovered** underlying (resumed from a non-empty durable journal, #85) keeps
//! its reconstructed book and journaled `underlying_sequence` — recover wins. The
//! phase therefore SKIPS the journaled opening-price [`SimStep`](crate::exchange::VenueCommand::SimStep)
//! (step 4) for it, since re-pricing would journal a **duplicate** record onto the
//! resumed stream. But step 3's persona/contract registration is purely **in-memory**
//! and never journals, so the phase STILL re-runs it for a recovered underlying —
//! otherwise the maker would have no contracts to quote and be **quote-silent** after
//! restart until an operator re-registered (#148). Its reference price was restored,
//! non-journaled, from the last recovered `SimStep` at boot
//! ([`MarketMakerEngine::seed_reference_price`](crate::market_maker::MarketMakerEngine::seed_reference_price)),
//! so once registered here the maker quotes around the **resumed** price on the next
//! live requote. Precedence + determinism: only `lineage_id` is rehydrated (not the
//! run seed), so a recovered underlying's persona comes from the CURRENT config
//! manifest, and post-resume MM/sim determinism relies on the operator supplying the
//! same run seed + config manifest.
//!
