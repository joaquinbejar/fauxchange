//! # fauxchange
//!
//! `fauxchange` (*faux* + *exchange*) is an exchange-in-a-box: a local
//! options exchange simulator for testing trading systems — "LocalStack
//! for trading". It wraps the upstream matching engine and option-chain
//! hierarchy from [`orderbook-rs`] / [`option-chain-orderbook`] behind
//! three protocol front-ends — REST, WebSocket, and a FIX 4.4 gateway
//! built on [`IronFix`] primitives — with deterministic record/replay,
//! configurable microstructure, JWT auth, and optional PostgreSQL
//! persistence.
//!
//! [`orderbook-rs`]: https://github.com/joaquinbejar/OrderBook-rs
//! [`option-chain-orderbook`]: https://github.com/joaquinbejar/Option-Chain-OrderBook
//! [`IronFix`]: https://github.com/joaquinbejar/IronFix
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Under active design and early implementation — see the numbered
//! design docs under `docs/` (source of truth during the design phase)
//! and `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the delivery plan starting at v0.1.0. This
//! crate is a **venue**, not a matching engine: matching, fills, fees,
//! self-trade prevention, and the option-chain hierarchy live upstream
//! and are never reimplemented here.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! `fauxchange` ships as a single crate with one binary; sub-domains are
//! modules, not workspace members. Dependencies flow one way only —
//! transport → application → domain / persistence / services:
//!
//! - **Transport** — [`gateway`], the three protocol front-ends (REST,
//!   WebSocket, FIX 4.4) that translate wire formats into venue commands.
//!   A gateway translates; it never decides.
//! - **Application** — [`state`], the shared wiring that assembles the
//!   domain, persistence, and service layers into the state every
//!   gateway handler is given; and [`seed`], the bounded seeding phase
//!   that applies a scenario manifest before the venue flips to serving.
//! - **Domain** — [`exchange`] (the sequenced order path onto the
//!   upstream matching stack), [`market_maker`] (persona-driven
//!   quoting), [`simulation`] (synthetic price generation and replay),
//!   [`microstructure`] (latency, fees, STP, contract specs), and
//!   [`ohlc`] (OHLC bar aggregation).
//! - **Persistence** — [`db`], optional `sqlx`/PostgreSQL storage for the
//!   journal, executions, and venue configuration; the venue runs fully
//!   in-memory when `DATABASE_URL` is unset.
//! - **Services** — [`auth`], JWT authentication and the permission
//!   model shared by every gateway; and [`subscription`], the WebSocket
//!   market-data service (the per-instrument subscription manager + broadcast
//!   fan-out) the `/ws` gateway reads through `AppState`.
//!
//! [`error`] and [`models`] are the shared boundary — typed errors mapped
//! to HTTP status codes and FIX rejects, and the DTOs that carry data
//! across every protocol surface — and are re-exported at the crate
//! root. [`config`] is cross-cutting: venue configuration.
//!
//! No module outside `gateway/` reaches into another gateway's
//! internals, and nothing in `src/` imports back from this crate root —
//! see `CLAUDE.md` "Module Boundaries" for the enforced rules.
//!
//! ## Determinism — the bounded, testable guarantee
//!
//! Determinism is `fauxchange`'s product, stated as a **bounded contract**, not a
//! byte-for-byte promise the dependencies cannot keep. Given the **same journal**
//! (the `venue.v1` `VenueEvent` stream, including the `MarketMakerControl` /
//! `Clock` / `SimStep` commands), the **same config manifest** (seed, clock mode,
//! microstructure config, instrument seed), and the **same pinned crate/dependency
//! versions**, a replay reproduces **identical fills, events, and resting book
//! state per underlying**, judged by *ordered `VenueEvent`-stream equality per
//! underlying* — top-of-book after each event is a cheap witness. Replay and
//! recovery share **one algorithm**: re-execution with the stored event as the
//! integrity oracle, always into a **fresh** registry.
//!
//! Excluded from the oracle, recomputed live and **never asserted equal**: mark
//! price, unrealised P&L, Greeks, and any derived analytic float; process-global
//! numeric registry ids (the canonical symbol string is the identity); the engine
//! clock and its `Uuid::new_v4()` trade-id namespace; cross-underlying interleaving
//! (there is no venue-wide total order); out-of-sequencer state (an admin snapshot
//! restore starts a new journal lineage — it is not a replay input); and OHLC bars
//! (an exclusion **by derivation** — the same fills reproduce the same bars). The
//! synthetic price **walk** is reproduced from the journal, **not** by seed
//! regeneration (the `optionstratlib` sampler owns its own RNG); every stored
//! expiry is an absolute `ExpirationDate::DateTime`. The guarantee and its full
//! exclusion index are enforced by the `tests/determinism.rs` oracle.
