# Changelog

All notable changes to `fauxchange` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),

The full versioning and release-process policy lives in the design docs
(local until v0.1.0).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Crate skeleton (#1): the canonical module tree from
  `docs/00-design-bootstrap.md` §6 as empty, `//!`-documented stubs —
  `config`, `error`, `models`, `state`, `gateway/{rest,ws,fix}`,
  `exchange`, `market_maker`, `simulation`, `microstructure`, `ohlc`,
  `db`, `auth` — plus `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, crate-level docs in
  `src/lib.rs` (`error`/`models` re-exported at the crate root), a
  commented bootstrap outline in `src/main.rs`, and the empty
  `tests/`, `benches/`, `migrations/`, `docker/` directories. No venue
  behavior yet — every module is an empty stub so later issues add code
  into a tree that already compiles.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Reserved the `fauxchange` crate name on crates.io.
