## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **The replay driver — reproduce identical events, fills, and top-of-book from
  the durable journal** (#30) in the new `src/simulation/replay.rs`
  (`replay_streams` / `replay_bundle`, `ScenarioBundle` / `JournalStream`,
  `ReplayReport`, `ReplayError`, `RecordingController`) with the record/replay
  control plane in `src/gateway/rest/replay.rs` + the WS `record` / `replay_bundle`
  actions ([030](milestones/v0.3-replay/030-replay-driver.md),
  [04 §4](docs/04-market-data-and-replay.md#4-historical-replay),
  [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-deterministic-replay-with-seeded-clock.md),
  [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-venue-command-envelope-and-single-writer-journal.md)).
  Replay and recovery share **one algorithm — re-execution**: the driver reuses
  the #29 `exchange::recover` core **verbatim** (never a second "apply the stored
  event" path), re-executing every `VenueCommand` in `underlying_sequence` order
  into a **fresh** `InstrumentRegistry` per underlying with the stored `VenueEvent`
  as the integrity oracle — a mismatch halts with `JournalCorruption { underlying,
  sequence }`, a newer-than-binary envelope schema is refused. Oracle equality is
  stated over **symbols + `underlying_sequence`** (never process-global registry
  ids); mark prices and unrealised P&L are recomputed **live** and excluded. Two
  input formats: the **native journal** and a portable **scenario bundle** (journal
  streams + the `RunManifest`, now extended with `instrument_seed`, a microstructure
  fingerprint, and the **pinned crate/dependency versions** — real compile-time
  values, all `#[serde(default)]` so an older manifest stays backward-readable);
  `replay_bundle` verifies the bundle schema + the manifest's pinned versions
  against the running binary first (a typed `VersionMismatch`), and a bundle
  without a manifest / a malformed bundle is a typed decode error, never a panic.
  Reproduction is **journal-driven, not seed-regenerated**: the live requote engine
  is muted (the offline driver never invokes it, so journaled market-maker
  `AddOrder`s replay with no cascade), and journaled non-order inputs
  (`EvictExpiredOrders { now_ms }`, `SetInstrumentStatus`, `Clock` / `SimStep`
  values) are applied **from the command**, never a replay clock. The **executions
  store** and **positions fold** are reconstructed from the same replayed events
  through the live post-journal `StoreFanOut`. The record/replay controls are
  `Admin`-gated with REST ≡ WS **control parity** (both surfaces flip the same
  `RecordingController` / run the same offline replay), and there is **no** FIX
  control surface. Scope is honestly **single-epoch**: a journal crossing a
  snapshot-restore boundary **fails stop** at the first post-restore command
  (the restore boundary is outside the determinism oracle), and reconstructing a
  restored cut plus **boot-time resume** of a non-empty durable journal into a live
  venue are tracked in #85. Exercised across unit, property
  (`journal_driver_replay_reconstructs_book`), the flagship `tests/determinism.rs`
  (same journal → same fills; exclusions tested as exclusions; multi-underlying
  partial control fan-out reproduced per underlying; replay-stable `DateTime`
  expiries; the restore-boundary fail-stop), `tests/parity.rs` (control + observation
  parity), and a `testcontainers` `postgres:18-alpine` integration test (record into
  a durable venue → export the bundle → replay offline → reconstructed executions +
  positions fold match the live goldens).
- **Durable persistence for the venue envelope journal — swap the store, keep
  the contract** (#29) in the new `src/db/journal.rs` (`PgVenueJournal`) and
  `src/exchange/recovery.rs` (`recover` / `Recovered`, the production recovery
  reducer), behind the unchanged `VenueJournal` trait
  ([029](milestones/v0.3-replay/029-persist-envelope-journal.md),
  [02 §6](docs/02-matching-architecture.md#6-the-journal),
  [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-venue-command-envelope-and-single-writer-journal.md)).
  The same `venue.v1` envelope the per-underlying actor already journaled
  in-memory is now durably persisted when `DATABASE_URL` is set (in-memory
  otherwise); the receipt / recovery / durability contract is **identical** —
  only the store changed. A new migration (`migrations/20260716120500_journal.sql`)
  adds a per-underlying `journal_headers` row (`lineage_id` + `schema_version`)
  and an append-only `journal_records` stream keyed **unique** on
  `(underlying, underlying_sequence, kind)`, storing each record's exact
  `venue.v1` bytes as `TEXT` (so a JSONB key-reorder can never mutate the
  oracle); an idempotent re-append is `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` + an O(1)
  read-back (identical payload → no-op, differing → typed `Conflict`). The
  write-ahead protocol is preserved on the durable store (confirmed pre-execute
  failure reuses `N`; an ambiguous append is resolved by durable tail read-back;
  a post-mutation event-append failure seals the underlying with
  `JournalUnavailable`). Recovery is **re-execution with the stored event as the
  oracle** (no event-applier): it reads the header first, refuses a
  newer-than-binary journal with the typed `JournalError::SchemaTooNew`, and
  halts on a divergent stored event with `JournalError::Corruption { underlying,
  sequence }`. `sqlx::Error` is mapped to typed domain errors at the boundary
  (never on a `pub` surface, never leaking `DATABASE_URL`); all queries are
  parameterised with the offline `.sqlx` cache committed. The boot-time replay
  **driver** (reload a snapshot and re-execute into a running venue) remains #30;
  until then a fresh boot persists forward and the unique key makes an accidental
  resume of a non-empty journal fail loud. Exercised by `testcontainers`
  `postgres:18-alpine` integration tests (recovery-by-re-execution,
  sequence-continuity across a snapshot epoch, idempotent re-append,
  newer-schema refusal), now wired into the CI `migrations` job.
- **The clock as a seeded venue service (realtime / accelerated / stepped) — the
  first v0.3 replay seam** (#28) in the new `src/simulation/clock.rs` (`SimClock`,
  `VenueClockConfig`, `ClockMode`, `CorrelationId`) and `src/simulation/manifest.rs`
  (`RunManifest` recording `seed` + `clock_mode`)
  ([028](milestones/v0.3-replay/028-clock-venue-service.md),
  [04 §5](docs/04-market-data-and-replay.md#5-clock-control),
  [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-deterministic-replay-with-seeded-clock.md)). Time is a
  venue service, not `SystemTime`: `SimClock` is the **one** clock the venue reads
  — the per-underlying actors stamp `venue_ts` from it, the price-walk cadence
  stamps its `SimStep.now_ms` from it, and the auth rate limiter reads it (so
  rate-limit decisions replay deterministically); `now_ms()` on the sequenced path
  is a pure atomic load with no wall-clock read (guarded by
  `tests/determinism.rs::test_no_wall_clock_read_on_the_sequenced_path`). A
  stepped advance is a per-underlying **sequenced, journaled** `Clock { now_ms }`
  command fanned to every actor by the `AppState` venue-control coordinator
  (`advance_clock_step` / `advance_clock_to`, returning a `ClockAdvance` that
  surfaces a partial fan-out), so replay reproduces the advance from the journaled
  value — never a replay clock. The `[clock]` config section gains the file-only
  `multiplier` (accelerated) and `step_interval_ms` (stepped) knobs
  (`deny_unknown_fields` preserved). **Named upstream limitation (documented, not
  silent):** `orderbook-rs` 0.10.5 exposes `OrderBook::with_clock` /
  `Arc<dyn Clock>`, but the pinned `option-chain-orderbook` 0.7.0 does not thread
  it through lazy `get_or_create_*` leaf construction, so deterministic `Day`/`GTD`
  time-in-force **admission** at the leaf is deferred to that upstream work — the
  cross-run check exists today as the clearly-labeled `#[ignore]`d
  `test_day_gtd_admission_determinism_blocked_by_leaf_clock_gap`, and the intraday
  `EvictExpiredOrders` sweep stays a journaled no-op
  ([02 §5.5b](docs/02-matching-architecture.md#5-determinism)).
- **The Docker e2e smoke test and the cold-bring-up wall-clock budget — the
  v0.2 "one command" proof** (#27) in the new `tests/docker_smoke.rs`,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `Makefile`, and `BENCH.md`
  ([027](milestones/v0.2-packaging/027-cold-bringup-e2e-smoke.md),
  [TESTING.md §9](docs/TESTING.md#9-docker-e2e-smoke),
  [07 §7](docs/07-performance-budgets.md#7-what-is-explicitly-out-of-budget),
  [PRD NFR-3](docs/PRD.md#4-non-functional-requirements)). `DOCKER=1`-gated
  (a plain `cargo test` self-skips cleanly — verified, the default suite stays
  green with no Docker present): `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml
  up -d` (image built once, untimed, ahead of the measured window — cold start
  is container-start + self-seed → serving, never `cargo build`) → the first
  successful `GET /health` `200` (the REST listener binds only AFTER the
  bounded seeding phase completes and `AppState::begin_serving()` flips,
  `src/main.rs`, so a live `/health` alone IS the serving-and-seeded signal) →
  mint a bootstrap token for the seeded `market-taker` account
  (`seeds/default.toml`) → place one market order over REST against the seeded
  at-the-money `BTC-20261231-50000-C` contract → observe the resulting fill
  over the SAME `fills` WS channel (subscribed BEFORE the order is placed, so
  the broadcast is never raced) → assert no panic in the container logs and a
  clean `docker compose down`. A `ComposeGuard` runs `docker compose down -v`
  in its `Drop` impl — proven to run on every exit path (`Ok`, `Err`, a panic
  unwind, or the outer `tokio::time::timeout` dropping the in-flight future) —
  so a failed run never leaks containers/volumes; the dedicated CI
  `docker-smoke` stage additionally runs an unconditional teardown step as a
  belt-and-braces safety net. **Verified against the real container, twice**
  (Docker 29.6.1, `fauxchange:local` 187 MB `runtime-slim`): cold bring-up
  measured **0.556 s** (image freshly built in the same invocation) and
  **0.483 s** (image already cached) — both real numbers, ~14× under the
  30 s DESIGN TARGET budget on a DB-less default local run (`BENCH.md` §8;
  never a fabricated figure, and explicitly not claimed to generalise to a
  `--profile persistent` cold start, a larger seed manifest, or a slower CI
  disk). **The persistent-mode durable journal append is now an explicit,
  binding separate budget line** (`BENCH.md` §7's HP-5 bullet), never folded
  into HP-1's in-memory sub-millisecond target — the durable quantiles
  themselves still land with the durable journal in v0.3 (#035); #027 only
  establishes and documents the separation. New CI stage `docker-smoke`
  (`needs: [image-build]`, `DOCKER=1`, NOT on the plain `test` job) builds the
  compose image, runs the test, and adds a belt-and-braces teardown step; new
  `make docker-smoke` target mirrors it locally. Two new dev-only
  dependencies, each a **zero-new-resolved-version** addition (verified
  against `Cargo.lock` before and after: no new `[[package]]` entry, only two
  new dependency edges from the `fauxchange` package itself) — `tokio-tungstenite`
  0.29 (the black-box WS client observing the fill over the real running
  container; already resolved transitively via `axum` 0.8.9's own `ws`
  feature) and `futures-util` 0.3 (the `StreamExt`/`SinkExt` traits
  `WebSocketStream` needs; already resolved transitively via `axum`/`tower`) —
  both dev-only, never reach the shipped image, already `cargo audit`/`cargo
  deny`-gated as existing transitive deps. The REST leg (health poll, token
  mint, order placement) deliberately adds **no** client dependency instead: a
  small hand-rolled HTTP/1.1 JSON client over the already-present
  `tokio::net::TcpStream` (`Connection: close`, read-to-EOF, no
  `Content-Length`/chunked parser needed) covers the three simple JSON calls,
  avoiding `hyper-util`'s client machinery (also already in the tree, but only
  for `axum`'s own server-side usage today). The stale `axum` `ws`-feature
  audit note ("no CLIENT WebSocket crate is added") is corrected to describe
  this new client honestly rather than left contradicting it.
- **Container hardening — non-root, a distroless variant, a no-baked-secrets
  scan, loopback metrics, read-only/dropped-caps run posture, and the
  supply-chain gate on the image build** (#26)
  ([026](milestones/v0.2-packaging/026-container-hardening.md),
  [08 §7](docs/08-threat-model.md#7-secrets-handling),
  [08 §8](docs/08-threat-model.md#8-supply-chain-controls),
  [08 §9](docs/08-threat-model.md#9-container-hardening-deployment),
  [06 §12](docs/06-deployment.md#12-container-hardening-v02-26)). Hardens the
  #25 working image without reshaping it. `docker/Dockerfile` now builds TWO
  runtime targets off the SAME `builder` stage: `runtime-slim` (unchanged
  default — last stage in the file, so a plain `docker build` / `docker
  compose build` still resolves here; `debian:bookworm-slim` + `curl`
  `HEALTHCHECK`) and the new `runtime-distroless`
  (`gcr.io/distroless/cc-debian12:nonroot`, **pinned by digest**, verified
  against the manifest-LIST digest so amd64/arm64 both resolve correctly; no
  shell, no package manager — `cc-debian12` was chosen because it ships
  exactly the glibc deps the release binary needs, verified via `ldd`:
  `libgcc_s.so.1`/`libm.so.6`/`libc.so.6`; no `HEALTHCHECK` on this target —
  there is no shell/curl to run one from inside the container, an honest
  tradeoff documented in the Dockerfile, not an oversight — `runtime-slim`
  stays the default so the one-command distribution keeps a working
  healthcheck). Both targets run as a fixed **uid/gid 65532** (the
  conventional distroless "nonroot" id, used on BOTH targets for one
  consistent PodSecurityContext / compose `user:` value regardless of base
  image) — verified with real `docker build --target
  runtime-slim`/`runtime-distroless` + `docker run --entrypoint id` /
  `docker inspect --format '{{.Config.User}}'`; both boot, self-seed, and
  serve `GET /health` (`200`), and an `exec sh` into `runtime-distroless`
  fails as expected (no shell). Measured local image sizes: `runtime-slim`
  187 MB, `runtime-distroless` 76.4 MB. New
  `docker/scan-image-secrets.sh` — the no-baked-secrets gate: scans ONLY the
  layer(s) carrying fauxchange's own `COPY` targets (the compiled binary, the
  baked `seeds/default.toml`) for an unrecognised PRIVATE KEY block (pinned
  by SHA-256 against the ONE known, reviewed `JwtAuth::dev()` fixture,
  src/auth.rs — a real leaked key still fails), a credentialed
  `postgres(ql)://user:pass@...` connection string, an
  `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET=value` assignment, and any `fix_password` other than
  the documented dev fixture (`dev-taker-secret-change-me`); deliberately
  scoped away from the upstream `debian:bookworm-slim` base image after
  verifying locally that an unscoped scan trips on GnuPG's OWN internal
  test-key fixtures (`gpgv`/`libgcrypt`, compiled in for `apt` package-
  signature verification) — Debian's supply chain, not a fauxchange-baked
  secret. Verified against a deliberately "dirty" test image (a smuggled real
  private key + a substituted `fix_password` in a separate `COPY` layer) to
  confirm the scan actually fails on a real finding, not just passes on a
  clean one; run in CI (`image-build` job) against both runtime targets, and
  locally via `docker/scan-image-secrets.sh <image-ref>`. The dev-keys
  release gate (`JwtAuth::release_gated`, shipped in #011) already refused
  `JwtAuth::dev()` keys without `--dev`/`FAUXCHANGE_DEV`; its named
  acceptance test `test_auth_refuses_dev_keys_without_flag` did not yet exist
  under that exact name (a functionally-identical test existed as
  `test_dev_key_release_gate_refuses_without_dev_mode`) — renamed to the
  milestone-specified name with a doc comment cross-referencing
  `docker/scan-image-secrets.sh` as the content-layer backstop on the same
  control. `:9090`'s loopback-only compose binding (already true since #25)
  now has a CI assertion (`docker compose config --format json | jq`,
  `image-build` job) so a future metrics server inherits it by construction.
  `docker-compose.yml`'s `fauxchange` service gains `read_only: true`,
  `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]` (an explicit
  `target: runtime-slim` was also added to its `build:` block, defensive
  against a future Dockerfile stage reorder) — verified locally
  (`docker run --read-only --cap-drop=ALL --security-opt
  no-new-privileges:true`, both targets) that the venue still serves
  `/health` with **zero `tmpfs` mounts**: it needed no writable path at all
  (fully in-memory, `tracing` to stdout only) — an honest finding, not a
  gap papered over with a defensive mount nothing exercises. The `postgres`
  service itself is NOT hardened here (out of scope; its data-directory /
  Unix-socket writable paths make read-only-rootfs a separate, non-trivial
  change). The `image-build` CI job now `needs: [cargo-audit, cargo-deny]` —
  a new advisory or a policy violation fails BEFORE either runtime image is
  built, wiring the existing #19 supply-chain gate onto the image build
  itself, not just the crate. No new Rust dependency (the scan script is
  bash + the runner's preinstalled `jq`/`python3`, matching #25's "no extra
  action to pin for a plain `docker build`" precedent).
- **Multi-stage `docker/Dockerfile` and the `docker/docker-compose.yml`
  one-command topology** (#25)
  ([025](milestones/v0.2-packaging/025-dockerfile-compose.md),
  [06 §2](docs/06-deployment.md#2-distribution-model),
  [06 §3](docs/06-deployment.md#3-docker-compose-topology),
  [06 §5](docs/06-deployment.md#5-ports-and-endpoints)). ONE crate, ONE
  binary, ONE image: a pinned `rust:1.97.0-bookworm` builder (matching
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, `SQLX_OFFLINE=true` against the committed `.sqlx/`,
  zero-warning `cargo build --release`) into a `debian:bookworm-slim` runtime
  (chosen over alpine/musl — the crate depends on `ring` via `jsonwebtoken`
  and `sqlx`'s `tls-rustls-ring`); non-root/distroless/read-only-rootfs
  hardening is #26 on top of this working image. The container `HEALTHCHECK`
  and the compose service healthcheck both poll `GET /health` (auth- and
  rate-limit-exempt, `src/gateway/rest/meta.rs`) via `curl`. Both persistence
  modes run from the **same image**: `DATABASE_URL` unset is fully in-memory
  (compose default); the `--profile persistent` overlay adds a pinned
  `postgres:18-alpine` (internal-only, no host port) and, once `DATABASE_URL`
  is exported pointing at it, `main.rs` opens the `PgPool` and runs
  `sqlx::migrate!` at boot — verified end-to-end locally in both modes
  (`docker compose up` and `--profile persistent up`), including a real
  `postgres:18-alpine` fix: its 18+ image layout requires a single volume
  mount at `/var/lib/postgresql`, not the pre-18 `.../data` convention.
  **Seed model reconciled against #24**: `docs/06 §3` (drafted pre-#24)
  describes a one-shot `seed` service driving the manifest over REST after a
  health check; #24 shipped a different, now-authoritative mechanism instead
  — the venue **self-seeds in-process** at boot (`src/seed.rs
  apply_seed_phase`, applied *before* `AppState::begin_serving()`, after which
  runtime hierarchy mutation is refused as a seed-time manifest input). A
  separate REST-driving seed service would duplicate that work or hit the
  post-flip refusal, so there is none: `docker-compose.yml` instead passes
  `--config /app/seeds/default.toml` (baked into the image) to the
  `fauxchange` service itself, in both profiles — `seeds/default.toml` and
  `seeds/README.md` are corrected to describe this (they previously also
  referenced a non-existent `FAUXCHANGE_CONFIG` env var; the seed sections
  load from the `--config <file>` layer only, `src/config.rs`). Ports match
  [06 §5](docs/06-deployment.md#5-ports-and-endpoints): `8080` REST/WS is
  live; `9878` FIX and `9090` metrics are **reserved** (`EXPOSE`d, and for
  metrics loopback-published in compose) but not yet backed by a listener —
  the FIX acceptor is v0.4 (`src/gateway/fix` is still a stub) and no
  Prometheus endpoint exists yet (verified: nothing answers on either port
  today). `FAUXCHANGE_DEV=1` is set in `docker-compose.yml` (not baked into
  the Dockerfile) because `main.rs` does not yet load a real RS256 key pair
  from mounted paths — only the embedded dev fixture, gated by
  `JwtAuth::release_gated`; without it the process **exits at startup**
  (`DevKeyRefused`) and the container never becomes healthy (a real deployment
  must not set this once real-key mounting lands, tracked with #26).
  `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` gets a documented,
  overridable dev default so the compose venue can mint a token immediately.
  `.dockerignore` (repo root) keeps `target/` (tens of GB locally) and every
  developer-only path (`docs/`, `rules/`, `milestones/`, `.claude/`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) out of the build context and every image layer.
  CI gets an additive `image-build` job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that
  builds the image and validates `docker compose config` in both profiles —
  build only, no push (a release-pipeline concern, docs/06 §10); the
  `docker-smoke` compose-up + one-order-round-trip e2e is #27.
- **The scenario seed format + the bounded seeding phase** (#24) in
  `src/config.rs`, the new `src/seed.rs`, and `seeds/`
  ([024](milestones/v0.2-packaging/024-seed-data-format.md),
  [06 §7](docs/06-deployment.md#7-seed-data-and-scenarios),
  [06 §8](docs/06-deployment.md#8-auth-bootstrap),
  [03 §10](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md#10-state-changing-operation-classification)).
  The `[accounts.*]` / `[instruments.*]` / `[market_maker.*]` config sections —
  previously `IgnoredAny` placeholders (#22) — are now **real, validated**
  `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` structs resolving into a `SeedManifest` on
  `Config::seed`, so a typo *inside* a seeded account or instrument now aborts
  startup naming the key. Every seeded expiry is validated at **load** to an
  absolute canonical `ExpirationDate::DateTime` (a `YYYYMMDD` date or a
  `23:59:59 UTC` instant); a relative `Days` expiry is **refused**
  (`ConfigError::SeedDaysExpiry`) because it is wall-clock-relative and breaks
  replay. Strike ladders must be non-empty with distinct positive strikes, and
  persona knobs are range-checked. `main.rs` assembles the venue in a bounded
  **seeding phase** (`AppStateConfig::with_serving(false)`), then
  `seed::apply_seed_phase` applies the manifest in a **fixed order** — default
  persona → account provisioning (idempotent, Argon2id-hashed FIX passwords) →
  contract registration → opening prices — and flips to **serving**
  (`AppState::begin_serving`). Opening prices are set through the #016 price seam
  as journaled `SimStep`s whose market-maker quotes **vivify** the leaf books onto
  the shared symbol index (the honest population path — there is no REST
  hierarchy-create; the inherited `POST /api/v1/underlyings/…` routes are refusal
  stubs, now **phase-aware**: refused as a seed-time manifest input once serving).
  Re-running the seeder is **idempotent** (an account or instrument already present
  at the same specs is a no-op; a conflicting spec — a different opening price, or
  an account id at different permissions — is a typed error). A default
  `seeds/default.toml` scenario ships two underlyings, a strike ladder on
  `DateTime` expiries, opening prices, a default persona, and a Read + a Trade
  account with credentials. Money stays **integer cents** throughout; no new
  dependencies (`toml` from #22, `argon2` from #12). Prior `AppState` /
  `AppStateConfig` construction is unchanged (the venue defaults to serving).
- **The optional `sqlx`/PostgreSQL persistence layer — a durable executions
  backend behind the v0.1 store contract** (#23) in `src/db/`, `migrations/`,
  and `.sqlx/`, wired into `src/main.rs` and `AppState`
  ([023](milestones/v0.2-packaging/023-optional-pg-persistence.md),
  [06 §6](docs/06-deployment.md#6-persistence),
  [05 §4.1](docs/05-microstructure-config.md#41-the-checked-fee-contract-saturation-made-unreachable),
  [08 §7](docs/08-threat-model.md#7-secrets-handling)). Persistence is
  **optional** and selected at **runtime**, not by a cargo feature: with
  `DATABASE_URL` unset the venue is fully in-memory; with it set, `main.rs`
  opens a `PgPool` and runs `sqlx::migrate!("./migrations")` at boot — one
  binary, both modes. The `sqlx` dependency (`0.9.0`, matching `sqlx-cli`) uses
  the `runtime-tokio` + `tls-rustls-ring` (ring-backed rustls, no OpenSSL/C) +
  `postgres` + `macros` + `migrate` features; pool size and the slow-`acquire`
  warning threshold come from a new `[persistence]` config surface
  (`FAUXCHANGE_DB_MAX_CONNECTIONS` / `FAUXCHANGE_DB_SLOW_ACQUIRE_MS`), never
  hard-coded. `PgExecutionsStore` implements the **same** #8 `ExecutionsStore`
  trait as the in-memory backend, and `select_executions_store(db)` returns
  whichever backend behind that one contract. **Scope, stated honestly:** in
  #23 the durable store is migration-verified and parity-tested through the #8
  contract (`tests/db.rs`), but the **live single-writer actor fan-out still
  writes and reads the in-memory store** — `AppState` does not yet route live
  fills through the PG backend, so with `DATABASE_URL` set live executions do
  **not** persist to Postgres yet. Promoting the durable store onto the live
  fan-out is coupled to the sync→async single-writer rewire + the durable
  journal/recovery (v0.3, #29). Every query is a **compile-time-checked**
  `sqlx::query!` / `query_as!`
  with bound parameters (`$1, $2, …`); no value or identifier is ever
  interpolated. Cents persist as `BIGINT` (`i64`) — lossless because
  `MAX_PRICE_CENTS` bounds them (no `f64` money). Migrations are timestamp-
  prefixed and immutable once merged: `executions` (the authoritative fill log,
  the only table with read/write code here), plus the `underlying_prices` /
  `market_maker_configs` / `system_control` / `accounts` **schema skeletons**
  (grounded in the #12 `Account` / `Credentials` model — `id`, `owner`,
  `permissions`, the Argon2id `password_hash` **never plaintext**,
  `fix_username`, the comp-id binding, `revocation_epoch`; their read/write
  code lands with the surfaces that own them, #24). `sqlx::Error` is mapped to
  a typed `DbError` carrying only a non-secret label and **never leaked through
  a `pub` signature** (`DbError` → `StoreError::Backend` for the store contract
  and → a redacted internal `VenueError`); the `DATABASE_URL` is never logged.
  **The durable command journal is NOT built here** — it stays in-memory, and
  journal-backed recovery is v0.3 (#29): this layer supplies the durable
  executions backend + the config/account tables (behind the #8 contract, not
  yet on the live fan-out; see above), but book/fold state is not recovered on
  restart, so **a restart without an admin snapshot is a fresh venue**
  (documented, not silently implied). Positions are a derived fold —
  **not** persisted (no PG positions store). The committed `.sqlx/` offline
  data lets every non-DB CI job (and the release build) compile **offline**
  (`SQLX_OFFLINE=true`); a new **`migrations`** CI job runs the migrations + the
  DB integration test against a real ephemeral `postgres:18-alpine` via
  `testcontainers` (an `#[ignore]`-gated `tests/db.rs` test proving durable ≡
  in-memory backend parity behind one contract; the default `cargo test` suite
  stays green WITHOUT Docker). `deny.toml` gains `CDLA-Permissive-2.0` (the
  Mozilla CA-bundle license from `webpki-roots`, via the rustls TLS stack) to
  its allow-list, with a justification; `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` stay green.
- **The layered venue config surface — file + env + CLI with
  `deny_unknown_fields`** (#22) in `src/config.rs`, wired into `src/main.rs`,
  with a new `.env.example` and a `config_validate_rejects_out_of_range`
  property ([022](milestones/v0.2-packaging/022-config-surface.md),
  [06 §4](docs/06-deployment.md#4-configuration),
  [05 §2](docs/05-microstructure-config.md#2-config-model),
  [08 §7](docs/08-threat-model.md#7-secrets-handling)). The v0.2 config
  foundation the later milestones **extend, never replace**. A run is
  configured from four layers merged in a **fixed precedence** — defaults
  (in code) → TOML file (`--config <path>`) → environment → CLI flags, later
  winning — each layer a field-wise overlay over an untyped `RawConfig`, then
  **validated once** into the typed effective `Config`. The v0.2 concerns:
  `[server]` (`FAUXCHANGE_HTTP_ADDR` / `--http-addr`, default `0.0.0.0:8080`),
  `[fix]` (`FAUXCHANGE_FIX_ADDR` / `--fix-addr`, default `0.0.0.0:9878`),
  `[persistence]` (`DATABASE_URL` / `--database-url` — **unset ⇒ in-memory**,
  set ⇒ the `PersistenceBackend::Postgres` toggle #23 consumes; the config
  decides the backend, not the DB module), `[clock]` (`FAUXCHANGE_CLOCK` /
  `--clock`, the `realtime | accelerated | stepped` enum carried through for
  the clock services #28), `[determinism]` (`FAUXCHANGE_SEED` / `--seed`, one
  run-level `u64` feeding the run **lineage id** namespace), `[auth]`
  (`AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`), and `[logging]` (`FAUXCHANGE_LOG_FORMAT` /
  `--log-format`, the `json | pretty` enum; structured-JSON emission is the
  observability milestone's #06). **`#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` on every
  file section + the top level**, so a typo aborts startup with a typed
  `ConfigError::UnknownKey` **naming the offending key** (extracted from
  serde's diagnostic) rather than silently defaulting — the ROADMAP v0.2
  acceptance item. **Boot-time validation before a single request**: bind
  addresses parse to `SocketAddr` (`BadAddress`), the clock/log-format enums
  check against their closed vocabularies (`InvalidClock` /
  `InvalidLogFormat`), and the seed parses as `u64` (`BadSeed`) — a
  `thiserror` `ConfigError` (no `anyhow`; distinct from the request-boundary
  `VenueError`) fails the process fast. **Secrets never reach a log**:
  `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL` are wrapped in a `Secret` newtype
  whose `Debug`/`Display` render `<redacted>` — redaction lives in one type,
  not at each call site — so the **effective config is logged once at boot**
  (`Config::render_effective`) with both secrets absent; the plaintext is
  reachable only through the explicitly-named `Secret::expose`, called at the
  DB pool / bootstrap gate. The `[accounts.*]` / `[instruments.*]` /
  `[microstructure.*]` / `[market_maker.*]` / `[rate_limits]` sections are
  **documented extension points** — accepted by the file loader today (typed
  `serde::de::IgnoredAny`, so a forward-looking config file is not rejected)
  but not validated here; the seed (#24) and v0.5 microstructure (#44–#47)
  swap each placeholder for a real `deny_unknown_fields` struct **without
  reshaping** the loader. `main.rs` now loads + validates the config first,
  logs the redacted effective config, and builds `AppStateConfig` from it
  (server bind address, seed → run lineage, bootstrap secret; the underlyings
  stay env-seeded until the `[instruments.*]` manifest #24). New dependency:
  `toml` 1 (`default-features = false, features = ["parse", "serde"]` — parse
  only, no serializer), which adds `toml` + `serde_spanned` to the tree (both
  `toml-rs`, MIT OR Apache-2.0, already on the `deny.toml` allow-list — **no
  new SPDX id, no `deny.toml` change**; `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` green);
  its parser deps (`toml_parser` / `toml_datetime` / `winnow` / `serde_core`)
  were already resolved, and **no CLI crate is added** — a small hand-rolled
  `--config`/scalar-override parser keeps `clap` (a dev-only transitive of
  `criterion`) out of the runtime binary. Injectable env lookup + explicit CLI
  args make the loader a pure, deterministic seam the unit and property tests
  drive without mutating the process environment (edition-2024 `set_var` is
  `unsafe`, forbidden here). Tests: unit (`src/config.rs`) — precedence
  (default/file/env/CLI each winning at its level), unknown-key rejection
  (naming the key, section + top-level), invalid clock / log-format / bind
  address / seed, the `DATABASE_URL` backend toggle, `--config` file selection
  + missing-file `FileRead`, empty-env-as-unset, seed → lineage, and the
  effective-config **secret redaction** (asserting both markers are absent
  from the render and the derived `Debug`); property
  (`config_validate_rejects_out_of_range`, `tests/property.rs`) — the
  validator accepts a clock/log-format/seed/address value **iff** it is
  genuinely valid, else fails with the matching typed `ConfigError`, the
  harness stood up for v0.5 to extend. `.env.example` declares every env var
  with its default and range per `rules/global_rules.md` *Configuration*.

- **Threat-model input hardening + captured-log credential test — the v0.1
  security capstone** (#21) across `src/models.rs`, `src/gateway/rest/mod.rs`,
  `src/auth.rs`, and a new `tests/security.rs`
  ([021](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/021-threat-model-input-hardening.md),
  [08 §4–§7](docs/08-threat-model.md#4-untrusted-input-hardening),
  [TESTING.md §14](docs/TESTING.md#14-security-testing)). Audits every v0.1
  untrusted input against the [08 §4](docs/08-threat-model.md#4-untrusted-input-hardening)
  table so each names its validation + resource ceiling + typed error, fills the
  gaps, and adds the defining security-test deliverables:
  - **The venue-owned max accepted/resting price ceiling** — the CODEX-tracked
    prerequisite the threat model names as the required economic-field bound.
    Two documented venue constants, `MAX_PRICE_CENTS` (`10^12` cents) and
    `MAX_ORDER_QUANTITY` (`10^6` contracts), are enforced in
    `validate_order_shape` (`src/models.rs`) — the boundary the REST/bulk
    handlers call **before** the sequenced order path. An order with
    `price > MAX_PRICE_CENTS` or `quantity > MAX_ORDER_QUANTITY` is a typed
    `400` (`InvalidOrder`), never accepted. A compile-time assertion pins the
    `MAX_PRICE_CENTS × MAX_ORDER_QUANTITY ≤ i64::MAX` invariant that keeps the
    per-leg fee narrowing (`SignedCents`/`i64`) and the upstream `notional × bps`
    product (`u128`) **off both saturation branches**.
  - **An explicit REST request-body ceiling** — `MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES`
    (`1` MiB) applied via `DefaultBodyLimit`, replacing axum's undocumented
    framework default with a *named* DoS bound an oversized body hits (`413`)
    before it is buffered; it pairs with the per-batch `MAX_BULK_ORDER_ITEMS`
    item cap.
  - **The venue-reserved market-maker identity guard** (tracked #15 follow-up) —
    `AccountRegistry::insert_account` now rejects provisioning any account whose
    id is the reserved `@market-maker` account or whose STP owner is the reserved
    `MARKET_MAKER_OWNER` (`Hash32([0xEE; 32])`) with a typed `AuthError::Provisioning`,
    so a seed/admin cannot shadow (impersonate or mass-cancel) the venue's own
    quotes.
  - **The captured-log credential test** (`tests/security.rs`) — drives a full
    mint → order → error flow with a `tracing_subscriber` capture layer installed
    (a `MakeWriter` over a shared buffer; no new dependency — `tracing-subscriber`
    is already a runtime dependency) and asserts no captured log, error response
    body, or serialised state contains a password, an Argon2id hash
    (`$argon2id$`), the JWT signing key, the bootstrap secret, the Argon2 pepper,
    or a DB connection string; the effective-config-at-boot log is asserted
    redacted.
  - **The auth/authorization matrix, adversarial fixtures, and DoS-control
    suites** — every mutating REST op rejects missing/insufficient permission; a
    `Read` account is refused order entry on REST and (via the frame parser) on
    WS; a revocation refuses the account's tokens; oversized bodies, truncated
    JSON, out-of-range economic fields, malformed symbols, and unknown DTO fields
    each produce the correct typed `4xx`/typed WS reject (never a panic, never a
    silent accept); and the rate limiter (one budget), bounded actor mailbox
    (backpressure → typed `RateLimited`), bounded broadcast (laggard drop, no
    OOM), connection cap, and sequence-exhaustion sealing are each exercised as
    **security controls**; the captured-log test additionally proves a
    spawned-actor-task tracing event lands in the capture buffer, so its
    credential-absence assertions are not vacuously true. No new dependency; no
    `.unwrap()` on any inbound-data path; no `unsafe`. Known follow-ups (tracked,
    out of #21 scope): the `modify_order` handler carries no economic-field ceiling
    yet because it is an inert stub returning `InvalidOrder` unconditionally — the
    ceiling lands when modify is wired to the sequenced path; and the
    auth/authorization matrix is representative, not exhaustive (every mutating
    handler structurally calls `require()` — a per-handler exhaustive-matrix test is
    a nice-to-have follow-up).
- **`bench-hdr` harness + first `BENCH.md` baseline** (#20) in `benches/`,
  `Cargo.toml`, `tests/bench_harness.rs`, and `BENCH.md` at the repo root
  ([020](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/020-bench-hdr-harness-baseline.md),
  [07 §5](docs/07-performance-budgets.md#5-benchmark-methodology-the-bench-hdr-convention)).
  Four registered `[[bench]]` targets (`harness = false`, so each controls its
  own measurement loop rather than criterion's default statistical-convergence
  runner): `hp1_order_path` (the sequenced order path — full-turn closed-loop,
  the upstream match cost paired per turn and reported as its own out-of-budget
  series, the resulting venue-added delta, the write-ahead command/event
  append's own cost, and a coordinated-omission-corrected open-loop sojourn-time
  series via a genuine intended-send-time load generator), `hp2_ws_fanout` (a
  committed `VenueEvent` fanned out to `N ∈ {1, 10, 100, 1 000}` subscriber
  broadcast slots over the real `TeeFanOut(StoreFanOut, WsFanOut)` /
  `OrderbookSubscriptionManager` from #008/#014, checking HP-1 p99 stays flat
  in N), `alloc_profile` (a `#[global_allocator]` counting-allocator profile of
  the steady-state actor turn, both direct (`UnderlyingActor::handle`) and via
  the async `ActorHandle::submit` mailbox round-trip), and a supplementary
  `criterion_match_cost` (a real, working example of the convention's
  "criterion for orchestration" half, explicitly never cited as `BENCH.md`
  evidence — mean is not an accepted quantile report). Every reported
  distribution goes through `benches/support/hdr.rs`'s `hdrhistogram`-backed
  p50/p99/p99.9/p99.99 report — never criterion's default mean — and the
  quantile/histogram plumbing itself is unit-tested against known
  distributions (uniform, constant, bimodal, empty) in
  `tests/bench_harness.rs` (5/5 passing), pulling in the exact same
  `benches/support/hdr.rs` file `cargo bench` uses via `#[path]` rather than a
  duplicated copy. Two new dev-only dependencies, each with a Cargo.toml audit
  note: `hdrhistogram` (`7`, `default-features = false` — only the base
  `Histogram` type is used, not `.hgrm` serialisation or `SyncHistogram`) and
  `criterion` (`0.8`, `default-features = false` — only `Bencher::iter` is
  used, not `rayon`/`plotters`/HTML reports). `BENCH.md` records the first
  real baseline: every figure was actually measured by running `cargo bench`
  on the reference host (Apple M4 Max, macOS, `rustc 1.97.0`) — none
  estimated or invented — with full run conditions, and every number is
  labelled a DESIGN TARGET comparison, never an achieved SLO. The baseline
  surfaces a real, reproducible finding worth a follow-up:
  `InMemoryVenueJournal::append`'s `(sequence, kind)` uniqueness check is a
  linear scan over the whole in-memory record stream, so the write-ahead
  append's cost — and therefore HP-1's full-turn p99/p99.9/p99.99 — grows
  with journal depth within a single run (p99 932 µs at ~105k journaled
  records vs 33 µs at ~2.2k, on the identical code path); HP-1's own "< 1 ms
  p99" DESIGN TARGET is only marginally met at that depth and is exceeded at
  p99.9/p99.99. The allocation profile likewise shows the steady-state turn is
  measurably far from the "zero heap allocation" DESIGN TARGET (~78 / ~63
  allocs per submitted command, direct vs. async-mailbox path) — honestly
  reported as a process-wide allocation-pressure count, not a call-stack
  attribution (no such profiler is available in this environment), and named
  as the regression-signal baseline going forward. HP-2's N-sweep confirms its
  DESIGN TARGET holds: p99 does not grow across a 1 000× increase in
  subscriber count. Deliberately out of scope, per the milestone: HP-3 (FIX
  parse, v0.4 #043), HP-4 (market-maker requote, v0.5 #050), HP-5 durable/
  PostgreSQL journal append (v0.3 #035), and the CI `bench-regression` gate
  (armed before v1.0, #053) — nothing in CI fails a PR on these numbers today,
  only confirms the benches compile (`cargo clippy --all-targets
  --all-features -- -D warnings`).

- **CI: `cargo audit` + `cargo deny` + fmt/clippy/test/build gates** (#19) in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deny.toml`, `.cargo/audit.toml`,
  `rust-toolchain.toml`, and the `Makefile`
  ([019](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/019-ci-audit-deny-lint.md),
  [08 §8](docs/08-threat-model.md#8-supply-chain-controls),
  [TESTING.md §11–§12](docs/TESTING.md#11-ci-matrix)). Wires the CI-matrix
  jobs — `fmt` (`cargo fmt --all --check`), `clippy`
  (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`), `test`
  (`cargo test --all-features`), `build-release` (`cargo build --release`,
  `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`), `doctests`, `msrv`, and the `golden` /
  `determinism` / `parity` suites (#4/#17/#18) — as the v0.1 **supply-chain
  gate from the first milestone**: `cargo-audit` and `cargo-deny` run on
  every push and on PRs into `main`/`release/**`, on a pinned runner
  (`ubuntu-24.04`) with every action pinned (no `latest`, no floating branch
  refs), and cancellation of superseded runs on this ref. `deny.toml`
  encodes the license allow-list actually present in the tree (MIT, MIT-0,
  Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, BSL-1.0, CC0-1.0, ISC, Unicode-3.0,
  Unlicense, Zlib, `bzip2-1.0.6` — enumerated with `cargo deny list`, no
  blanket wildcard), a crates.io-only source policy, a `wildcards = "deny"`
  ban on unpinned dependency ranges, and one documented advisory ignore
  (RUSTSEC-2024-0436, `paste` unmaintained — a compile-time proc-macro dep
  transitive via `optionstratlib → statrs → nalgebra → simba`, **not** a
  vulnerability, no safe upgrade available upstream); `.cargo/audit.toml`
  mirrors the same ignore for the `cargo audit` CLI a developer runs
  locally, so the two tools agree. The `[graph] targets` restriction to the
  platforms `fauxchange` actually builds for (Linux gnu/musl, macOS
  aarch64/x86_64) prunes UEFI/wasm-only transitive deps (`r-efi`,
  `LGPL-2.1-or-later`) that never compile here, rather than papering over
  them with a license exception. No actual vulnerability was found on the
  current dependency tree — a real advisory is never added to either ignore
  list; it fails the build. `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the stable toolchain
  (1.97.0); the `msrv` job pins 1.96.0, the verified floor
  (`expiration_date`, transitive via `optionstratlib`, requires rustc
  1.96 — confirmed locally that `cargo +1.95.0 check --all-features` fails
  and `cargo +1.96.0 check --all-features` passes). The `msrv` job's
  `cargo check` uses an explicit `cargo +${{ env.RUST_MSRV }}` override
  rather than relying on `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`'s `rustup default`: rustup
  toolchain-selection precedence is `+toolchain` override >
  `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` env > `rust-toolchain(.toml)` file > `rustup default`,
  and the repo-root `rust-toolchain.toml` (pinning 1.97.0) OUTRANKS a bare
  `rustup default 1.96.0` — so an unqualified `cargo check` in that job
  would silently compile under 1.97.0 and never exercise the MSRV floor it
  claims to gate (confirmed locally: plain `cargo -V` resolves 1.97.0 with
  `rust-toolchain.toml` present; `cargo +1.96.0 -V` correctly resolves
  1.96.0 despite it). The `Makefile` adds `pre-push`
  (`fix fmt lint-fix test check-spanish release readme doc` — every binding
  Pre-Submission Checklist item in one canonical local gate, so local and CI
  never diverge), `lint-fix`, `check-spanish` (a diacritics heuristic over
  `src/` + `tests/` per `rules/global_rules.md`), `audit`, `deny`,
  `test-conformance`, `coverage`/`coverage-html`, `publish`, `run`/
  `run-seeded`, and `workflow-<job-id>` targets that run any CI job locally
  via `act` against the stable job ids above. Explicitly out of scope (per
  the milestone doc's Scope): the `fuzz` job (FIX gateway, v0.4), the
  `bench-regression` gate (armed before v1.0), the `migrations` job (lands
  with the optional PostgreSQL persistence layer, v0.2 #023), and the
  `docker-smoke` / `image-build` stages (land with the Dockerfile/compose
  topology and container hardening, v0.2 #025/#026, and the cold-bring-up
  e2e smoke, v0.2 #027). No `src/` change; no new crate dependency
  (`cargo-audit` / `cargo-deny` are CI-installed tools, not crate deps).
- **The v0.1 protocol-parity suite** (#18) in `tests/parity.rs` +
  `tests/conformance/`
  ([018](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/018-parity-fixtures-rest-ws.md),
  [03 §7](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md),
  [TESTING.md §6–§7](docs/TESTING.md)). The milestone's primary acceptance test —
  the contract that the surface an order arrives on does not change what the
  venue does — scoped to the surfaces present at v0.1 (REST + WS; FIX joins at
  v0.4). **Reachability:** every documented Backend REST route is served with its
  OpenAPI shape (a `(path, methods)` inventory checked against the live
  `/api-docs/openapi.json`, plus a representative live-router sweep), and every
  documented WS message round-trips to its #004 golden. **Observation parity
  (REST ≡ WS):** one committed fill renders identically as a REST
  `ExecutionRecord` and a WS `fill` on the four join keys
  (`execution_id`/`liquidity`/`underlying_sequence`/`venue_ts`) plus
  price/quantity/side — both projections of the same committed event — while the
  WS `fill` omits `account`/`fee` (the public anonymised print) and the REST
  record carries them (the authoritative account-scoped log). **Market-data
  parity:** `orderbook_delta` carries a strictly-increasing per-instrument
  `instrument_sequence` and resulting-quantity semantics (the change quantity is
  the level's new total), and a laggard gap recovers by a fresh snapshot, never a
  resend. **Control parity (REST ≡ WS):** the REST kill-switch/enable and the WS
  `kill`/`enable` actions build the identical `MarketMakerControl` command and
  surface the identical honest not-routable outcome (`InvalidOrder` on both, not
  a fabricated success — the command is not yet routable, #015), and the Admin
  permission gate is identical across surfaces. **REST order-entry base:** place /
  partial-fill / cancel-replace driven over the live REST surface against
  identically-seeded fresh venues, compared under the documented **normalization
  rule** — protocol-only fields (transport `venue_ts`, and the per-surface
  order-id / `ClOrdID` mapping placeholders `order_id`/`new_order_id`/
  `client_order_id`) are normalized away, while `underlying_sequence`,
  `execution_id`, fills, and resting-book state are compared **verbatim**;
  unit-tested for which fields are stripped vs kept (including the STP
  `stp_cancelled` outcome shape). The normalization helper, the per-surface
  fresh-venue topology, and the cross-surface join-key projection live in a
  reusable `tests/conformance/` module so the v0.4 FIX order-entry arm (#41) and
  the v1.0 packaged conformance harness (#51) **extend** the suite rather than
  rewrite it.
- **The flagship determinism harness** (#17) in `tests/determinism.rs`
  ([017](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/017-determinism-test-harness.md),
  [02 §5–§6](docs/02-matching-architecture.md),
  [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-venue-command-envelope-and-single-writer-journal.md),
  [TESTING.md §5](docs/TESTING.md)). The one canonical record/replay harness
  `fauxchange`'s bounded determinism contract ships against from v0.1: `record`
  drives a `VenueCommand` stream through a fresh `MatchingExecutor`, journaling
  every write-ahead `(command, event)` pair and capturing the per-event
  top-of-book witness (proven to mirror a real `UnderlyingActor` journal
  record-for-record — `VenueEvent` value equality); `replay` reconstructs the
  events + witnesses by re-executing
  every journaled `VenueCommand` in `N` order into a **fresh** registry; and the
  **oracle** asserts ordered-`VenueEvent`-stream equality per underlying plus the
  top-of-book cheap witness. `recover` is the recovery-as-re-execution reducer —
  the same re-execution with the stored `VenueEvent` as the **integrity oracle**:
  a clean journal re-executes to events equal to the stored ones, a **corrupted
  stored event** halts with the typed `JournalCorruption { underlying, sequence }`
  naming the exact `(underlying, N)`, a **tail command with no paired event**
  re-executes to derive the event, and a **newer-than-binary envelope schema**
  refuses to start. **Exclusions are asserted AS exclusions**: mark price,
  unrealised P&L, Greeks, `instrument_sequence`, and the engine `Uuid`
  trade-id / clock namespace are **structurally absent** from a journaled
  `VenueEvent` (a `Fill` carries only its nine journaled join keys), two replays
  with **different live marks** still agree on the event stream while the
  live-recomputed unrealised P&L differs, and two records under **different venue
  clocks** capture identical outcomes (only `venue_ts` differs). **Fault injection
  at both append stages** (a consolidated `FaultJournal` over the real actor): a
  pre-execution append failure reuses `N` with no gap and replay reconstructs
  identically; a post-mutation event-append failure seals the underlying, and a
  restart re-executes the tail command to the identical event (the crossing fill
  survives the seal). **Lossless capture**: an `IOC` order that fills and returns
  `Err` from the upstream `_full` leaf is journaled with its fill (never a bare
  `Rejected`) and replays identically, and a **partial `Replace`** (cancel
  succeeded, `FOK` add rejected) replays as one identical
  `Replace { cancelled: true, add: Rejected }`. **Replay-stable expiries**: a
  canonical `ExpirationDate::DateTime` fixture replays identically, and a
  `Days`-relative expiry is rejected at load. Consolidates the determinism rows
  previously scattered across `tests/{order_path,actor,stores,snapshot,
  market_maker,simulation}.rs` into the one suite the `determinism` CI job (#19)
  targets; the randomised `journal_replay_reconstructs_book` property stays in
  `tests/property.rs`. Tests-only — no `src/` change.

- **The `PriceSimulator` over `optionstratlib` walks routed through the
  sequencer** (#16) in `src/simulation/`
  ([016](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/016-price-simulator-walks.md),
  [04 §2](docs/04-market-data-and-replay.md),
  [specs §5](docs/specs/option-chain-orderbook-backend.md#5-simulation-and-ohlc)).
  The Backend `PriceSimulator` is ported: an async interval loop that walks each
  configured underlying and publishes `PriceUpdate`s over a **bounded**
  `tokio::broadcast`, with `get_price` / `get_all_prices` / `set_price`; paths are
  pre-generated over a horizon and regenerated **off-lock** when exhausted, and a
  walk failure backs the asset off dormant rather than busy-looping. `WalkTypeConfig`
  surfaces the v1 set — `GeometricBrownian` / `MeanReverting` (OU) / `JumpDiffusion` —
  each mapped 1:1 onto an `optionstratlib::simulation::WalkType`; the walk runs
  **entirely through `optionstratlib`** (no hand-rolled stochastic process), and
  the **`f64` boundary is guarded** on the way back to integer `Cents` (a
  non-finite / negative / out-of-range price is rejected, never cast). Each step
  is **not** a bare price write: it enters the venue through a `VenueStepSink`,
  which routes it onto the per-underlying sequenced order path as a journaled
  `VenueCommand::SimStep` **and** drives the market maker (#15
  `update_price`), whose requotes enter the **same** actor path as their own
  journaled `AddOrder`s — so synthetic prices and the liquidity they induce are
  both replayable exactly like real order flow. A manual `set_price` override is
  journaled the same way. **The `now_ms` comes from a deterministic virtual venue
  clock** (`start_ms + step × step_ms`), never `SystemTime`, and is carried in the
  `SimStep` so replay reuses the exact value. **Determinism is journal-driven, not
  seed-regenerated**: `optionstratlib`'s walk sampler builds its own RNG per draw
  and cannot consume the run seed, so the walk is excluded from same-seed
  regeneration; the guaranteed reproduction is the journal — the integration test
  runs a simulated session (journaled `SimStep`s + requotes → a crossing fill) and
  the determinism test replays the journal into a **fresh** venue (with the live
  market maker muted, #15 `set_muted`) and reproduces byte-identical events,
  price path, and fills without cascading duplicate orders. Wired into `AppState`
  (replacing the `SimulatorPlaceholder`); the interval loop is not auto-started
  (a stepped-clock / bootstrap concern). **No new dependencies** — the
  `optionstratlib::simulation` API is in the existing (no-feature) build.

- **The market maker on the sequenced order path — `MarketMakerEngine` /
  `OptionPricer` / `Quoter`** (#15) in `src/market_maker/`
  ([015](milestones/v0.1-backend-core/015-market-maker-on-sequenced-path.md),
  [02 §4](docs/02-matching-architecture.md),
  [specs §3](docs/specs/option-chain-orderbook-backend.md#3-market-maker)). The
  Backend market maker is ported as the persona substrate with the `fauxchange`
  seam wired in: a requote is a **journaled `VenueCommand`, not a side channel**.
  A price update triggers `update_price → requote_symbol → update_quote`, which
  cancels the stale two-sided quote and adds a fresh one **through a
  `CommandSink`** onto the same per-underlying single-writer actor + journal as
  client orders — never a direct book call — so generated liquidity is part of
  the determinism oracle and replays exactly. Every requote order carries the
  venue-reserved market-maker identity (`market_maker_account()` /
  `MARKET_MAKER_OWNER`) so fills attribute to the maker and the WS subscription
  manager **suppresses the `orderbook_delta` for a requote** (MM liquidity lands
  in the next periodic snapshot; the rule keys on `is_market_maker_command`).
  **Options math goes entirely through `optionstratlib`** — `OptionPricer` builds
  an `optionstratlib::Options` and calls `optionstratlib::pricing::black_scholes`
  for the theoretical value and the `optionstratlib::greeks::Greeks` trait for
  `delta`/`gamma`/`vega`/`theta` (no hand-rolled Black-Scholes or Greeks; the
  Backend's `erf`/`norm_cdf` pricer is dropped). The **`f64` boundary is guarded**
  end-to-end: a non-finite/degenerate input yields `None`, never a poisoned
  value into a `QuoteParams`, an `AddOrder`, or a broadcast; money stays integer
  cents on the surface. **Determinism**: time-to-expiry is derived from the
  **venue clock** (`set_venue_now_ms`), never the wall clock, so
  `generate_quote` is a pure function of its `QuoteInput`. The persona knobs
  (`MarketMakerConfig { enabled, spread_multiplier, size_scalar,
  directional_skew }`) are clamped to `[0.1,10.0]` / `[0.0,1.0]` / `[-1.0,1.0]`
  with NaN-rejecting `validate_control_value`; every clamp change ends in a
  requote + a `ConfigChanged` broadcast. Also: the kill switch
  (`set_enabled`/`set_symbol_enabled`, `cancel_all_orders`/`cancel_symbol_orders`),
  the `on_order_filled` edge calc (`calculate_edge`, integer & overflow-safe),
  the bounded `MarketMakerEvent` broadcast (`subscribe()`), and the **replay-mute
  hook** (`set_muted` — a muted engine records prices but cascades no live
  requote, so the v0.3 replay driver's journaled requotes are never duplicated).
  Wired into `AppState` (replacing the `MarketMakerPlaceholder`) via an
  `ActorCommandSink` over the per-underlying actor handles; the requote loop runs
  off the client order path (a slow requote never inflates a client `AddOrder`'s
  latency). Venue-global `MarketMakerControl` routing through `AppState::submit`
  stays a documented control-plane seam — the engine and its setters are ready
  for it, but `submit` still declines a `MarketMakerControl` as not
  per-underlying-routable.
- **The WebSocket surface — the `WsMessage` protocol, channel producers, and the
  subscription manager** (#14) in `src/gateway/ws/` + the new `src/subscription.rs`
  service module ([03 §4, §4.1, §4.2](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md),
  [01 §9.1](docs/01-domain-model.md)). `GET /ws` upgrades to the tagged
  `WsMessage` protocol behind an authenticated handshake: the bearer JWT is read
  from the `Authorization` header **or** a `?token=` / `?access_token=` query
  parameter (a browser WebSocket cannot set headers) and admitted through the
  venue's one `AuthService::admit` (baseline `Read`) — a missing/invalid token or
  an exhausted rate-limit budget **refuses the upgrade** (`401`/`429`), the socket
  never opens. The `OrderbookSubscriptionManager` (replacing the #010
  subscriptions placeholder in `AppState`) keeps a per-instrument monotonic
  `instrument_sequence` — the market-data namespace, **separate** from the
  journaled `underlying_sequence`, gap-repaired only by a fresh snapshot, never a
  resend — plus an event-sourced L2 aggregate over a **bounded**
  `tokio::broadcast` fan-out. **Every advertised channel has a real
  producer/filter/sequence policy**: `orderbook` (committed book mutation →
  snapshot then strictly-increasing resulting-quantity deltas), `trades` (one
  public print per match), `fills` (one **anonymised** print per committed fill
  leg — the four join keys only, **never** `account`/`fee`; account-scoped detail
  stays REST/FIX), and `prices` (the committed `SimStep` override); `quotes` is
  honest-pending on the `Quoter` (#015). **Only user-driven book mutations emit
  `orderbook_delta`** — a control-plane event never does. **Layering**: the
  manager + `WsFanOut` are a `crate::subscription` **service** (a sibling of
  `crate::auth`/`crate::ohlc`, **not** a gateway), so `AppState` owns them without
  importing `crate::gateway`; the generic `TeeFanOut` fan-out combinator lives in
  `crate::exchange` beside the `FanOut` trait. **Critical fan-out wiring**: a
  `WsFanOut` (a #006 `FanOut` impl) is composed with #008's `StoreFanOut` via the
  exchange-owned `TeeFanOut`, so `AppState` feeds the **same** post-journal
  `VenueEvent` to both the stores and the WS broadcast; the broadcast enqueue is
  O(1) and non-blocking, off the actor's critical path (a laggard drops and
  re-snapshots, never stalling the order path). **Client → server actions**
  (`subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`batch_*`/`list_subscriptions`) manage per-connection
  subscription state capped at `MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PER_CONNECTION` (256, a DoS
  control); the market-maker control actions (`set_spread`/`set_size`/`set_skew`/
  `kill`/`enable`) are rate-limited **then** `Admin`-gated (admission-first) and
  routed as sequenced `MarketMakerControl` commands (control parity, REST ≡ WS).
  **WS carries no order entry** — any place/cancel/replace-shaped frame is
  rejected with the typed (non-terminal) `WsError` envelope; an auth/terminal
  error closes the socket, a command error keeps it open. **DoS bounds**
  (docs/08 §5): a venue-wide concurrent-connection cap (`MAX_WS_CONNECTIONS` = 1024,
  a semaphore permit per socket → `503` at the ceiling, released on close), an
  idle/liveness reaper (a heartbeat protocol ping each 30 s; a connection with no
  inbound traffic for `MAX_IDLE_TICKS` = 4 ticks is closed), an up-front
  `MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (64) cap on `batch_*` before the array is iterated, and a
  64 KiB inbound frame/message cap (replacing axum's 16 MiB/64 MiB defaults).
  **Live-session re-validation**: each heartbeat tick re-checks the socket's
  session via `AuthService::revalidate_session` — a token revoked or expired since
  the handshake closes the socket with the terminal `Unauthorized` error (the
  handshake admits only once). Enables the axum `ws` feature (pulls
  `tokio-tungstenite` + `tungstenite` + `data-encoding` + `futures-sink` NEW;
  `sha1`/`base64` were already in the tree — only a new dep edge) and promotes
  `serde_json` to a direct dependency for client-frame parsing (already in the
  tree — no new crate); `BookSide` gains a derived `Ord` for the manager's
  touched-level set (additive, no wire change). **`MarketMakerControl` routing
  seam**: `AppState::submit` does not yet route the venue-global
  `MarketMakerControl` (a #010 deviation), so the control actions surface the
  honest not-routable error rather than fabricate a success — the same seam #013's
  REST controls hit. Tests: unit (subscribe→snapshot→delta ordering, anonymised
  fill shape, requote-no-delta, sub-cap enforcement, order-entry-frame rejection,
  control forbidden/rate-limit-first/not-routable non-terminal, connection-cap
  ceiling, batch-cap rejection, session revalidation revoke/expire/unknown);
  property (`ws_instrument_sequence_monotonic_per_symbol`); integration
  (`tests/ws.rs`) — the real `GET /ws` handshake over a bound server
  (`401`/`101`/query-param `101`/`429`), subscribe→sequenced-deltas-never-backward,
  laggard re-snapshot, live-session revalidation closes a revoked socket, and the
  typed error envelope close-vs-continue semantics.
- **The REST gateway — the ~50-route Backend surface on Axum 0.8 with utoipa
  OpenAPI + Swagger UI** (#13) in `src/gateway/rest/`
  ([03 §3, §10](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md),
  [specs/option-chain-orderbook-backend.md §1](docs/specs/option-chain-orderbook-backend.md)).
  `create_router(Arc<AppState>) -> Router` assembles every Backend route group —
  health/meta, auth-token, controls, prices, underlyings/expirations/strikes
  hierarchy CRUD, volatility-surface, chain matrix, per-contract
  book/orders/quote/greeks/snapshot/last-trade/ohlc/metrics, orders (bulk +
  cancel-all), positions, executions, admin snapshots — as handlers extracting
  `State(Arc<AppState>)` and returning `Result<Json<T>, VenueError>`, each with
  `#[utoipa::path]` and its #004 DTOs registered in the served
  `/api-docs/openapi.json`; the Swagger UI is merged at `/swagger-ui`.
  **Order-entry is re-pointed onto the sequenced path**: `POST .../orders`,
  `.../orders/market`, `DELETE .../orders/{id}`, and bulk-place each translate to
  an `AddOrder`/`CancelOrder` `VenueCommand` submitted through `AppState::submit`
  (never a direct book call) and return the resulting event's
  `underlying_sequence` for cross-surface correlation. **Operation-class routing**
  ([03 §10](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md#10-state-changing-operation-classification)):
  `POST /api/v1/prices` is journaled as a **SimStep**-class command (not a bare
  price write), runtime hierarchy create/delete is **refused as a manifest
  input**, and auth-token issuance + admin snapshots are replay exclusions.
  **Auth on every mutating op**: a shared JWT + sliding-window rate-limit layer
  (`AppState::auth().admit`) gates a baseline `Read` for all non-exempt routes
  and each handler gates its own `Trade`/`Admin`; `GET /health` is exempt from
  both, `POST /api/v1/auth/token` is JWT-exempt but peer-rate-limited. The
  **`ConnectInfo<SocketAddr>` → `PeerAddr`** injection layer feeds the real socket
  peer (never an `X-Forwarded-For` header) to the rate-limit key, and a bounded
  periodic task runs `RateLimiter::sweep_expired` off the request path (both
  DoS controls, [08 §5](docs/08-threat-model.md)). Adds `utoipa-swagger-ui` 9
  (axum 0.8, `vendored` assets → offline-safe build) and enables the axum
  server + tokio `net`/`time` features; `src/main.rs` now serves the router with
  the dev-key release gate. Book-state reads (quote/depth/chain/greeks/metrics),
  venue-global controls, and live snapshot capture/restore are honest empty
  projections or typed errors pending the actor book-read path and control-plane
  routing (flagged as `matching-expert` seam dependencies — no fabricated data).
  Review-hardening: the bulk endpoints are bounded (`MAX_BULK_ORDER_ITEMS` /
  `MAX_BULK_CANCEL_ITEMS` = 500, a DoS control so one account cannot monopolize a
  single-writer mailbox); `TokenRequest`'s `Debug` is hand-rolled to **redact the
  bootstrap secret**; `CancelOrderResponse`, `BulkOrderResultItem`, and
  `InstrumentToggleResponse` carry a **typed `sequence`** (not prose) so #018
  parity can read it; the limit-order status is TIF-aware so a killed `IOC`/`FOK`
  reports `Rejected` (never a false `Accepted`), and the instrument toggle reports
  *accepted and sequenced* rather than a confirmed effect (the applied/rejected
  outcome waits on the `Receipt`→`VenueOutcome` seam). `src/main.rs` installs a
  `tracing-subscriber` (fmt + `RUST_LOG` env filter) at boot so startup logs are
  not dropped.
- **The venue account registry — credentials, revocation epoch, and
  account-resolved bootstrap minting** (#12) in `src/auth.rs`, wired into
  `src/state.rs` ([ADR-0007](docs/adr/0007-fix-credentials-and-account-model.md),
  [01 §8](docs/01-domain-model.md), [06 §8](docs/06-deployment.md)). The
  registry-internal `Account { id (IS the JWT sub), owner: Hash32, permissions,
  credentials, revocation_epoch }` and `Credentials { fix_username, password_hash
  (Argon2id PHC, #[serde(skip_serializing)]), fix_comp_ids }` model an account
  once behind both credential paths; the `CompIdBinding` (SenderCompID,
  TargetCompID) is **declared now, enforced from v0.4** (ADR-0010). The in-memory
  `AccountRegistry` (DashMap) provisions from an explicit `Vec<AccountProvision>`
  (the seed-manifest **format** is #024), indexes accounts by `AccountId` (a
  direct JWT-`sub` lookup) **and** by FIX `Username (553)`, both resolving one
  account row + permission set, and implements the #011 `RevocationOracle`
  (`current_revocation_epoch`) so a `revoke` (which bumps the epoch) refuses the
  account's outstanding tokens on the next request via the existing
  `auth_middleware`. **Account-resolved minting** (`AccountRegistry::mint_for_account`,
  exposed as `AppState::mint_token`) replaces the Backend's ephemeral-subject
  minting: it authorises `AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` **first** (no account
  enumeration pre-auth), resolves an **existing** `AccountId` to its **registered**
  permissions + current revocation epoch, and mints via #011's
  `JwtAuth::mint_token` — never a fresh `Uuid`, never arbitrary requested
  permissions. Passwords are hashed with **Argon2id** (`Argon2Hasher`) at the
  pinned OWASP baseline (`m = 19456 KiB`, `t = 2`, `p = 1`) with an optional
  `AUTH_PASSWORD_PEPPER` (an Argon2 secret, never written into the PHC string),
  constant-time verification, and **rehash-on-verify** when a stored hash used
  weaker parameters (`PasswordVerification`); the FIX login path
  (`verify_fix_password` → `FixLoginOutcome`) is schema-ready for the v0.4
  acceptor and equalises unknown-username timing. The plaintext, the hash, and the
  pepper never appear on the wire (the `password_hash` is `skip_serializing`) or
  in a log/error (redacting `Debug` on `Credentials` / `Account` / `AccountProvision`
  / `PasswordVerification` / `Argon2Hasher`; issuance errors carry only static
  labels). The `AccountStore` trait (a `RevocationOracle` supertrait exposing
  lookup-by-id / lookup-by-fix-username / verify / revoke / count) is the drop-in
  seam for the v0.2 PostgreSQL `accounts` backend (#023/#024); `AppState`
  currently pins the concrete `Arc<AccountRegistry>` (so `mint_for_account` stays
  an inherent method), and the v0.2 swap to `Arc<dyn AccountStore>` promotes
  `mint_for_account` to a trait default method — a localized change confined to
  `src/auth.rs`/`src/state.rs`, invisible to the gateways. `AppState` now owns
  the `AccountRegistry` and a
  **real** `AuthService<FixedClock>` (replacing `AuthPlaceholder`), pinned to the
  venue clock, with the registry (as `RevocationOracle`) as its oracle;
  `AppStateConfig` gains an optional `AuthConfig` (JWT key pair / `dev()`,
  bootstrap secret, pepper, provisioned accounts, rate-limit budget) and
  `AppState::new` is now fallible (`Result<Arc<Self>, AuthError>`) on the auth
  build. New dependencies: `argon2` 0.5 (pure-Rust RustCrypto Argon2id) and
  `rand_core` 0.6 with `getrandom` (already in the tree; only the salt CSPRNG
  feature is added).

- **JWT (RS256/x509) auth, the `Permission` implication, and the sliding-60 s
  `RateLimiter`** (#11) in `src/auth.rs` — the **one** authorization model across
  every surface ([ADR-0005](docs/adr/0005-jwt-auth-for-rest-ws.md),
  [03 §6, §6.1](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md),
  [01 §8](docs/01-domain-model.md)); the legacy Backend `ApiKeyStore` /
  `sk_live_` path is **not** carried over (JWT is the only credential mechanism).
  `JwtAuth` signs RS256 tokens with an x509 key pair: `from_paths(cert, key)` /
  `from_pem` load the PEM pair with the **public key extracted from the
  certificate** (jsonwebtoken's `DecodingKey::from_rsa_pem` reads a `CERTIFICATE`
  PEM directly, so no separate x509 parser is pulled), `mint_token` /
  `verify_token`, and a clearly-labelled `dev()` fixture built from an **embedded,
  non-secret** dev keypair. `verify_token` pins **RS256** (rejecting `alg:none`
  and HS256 algorithm-confusion), enforces `exp`, and collapses every failure to a
  redacted `VenueError::Unauthorized` — the token and the cause are never logged
  or returned. `Claims` carries `sub` (the `AccountId`), the permission set, `iat`
  / `exp`, and the account `revocation_epoch`; `Claims::has_permission` applies the
  `Admin ⇒ Read + Trade` implication via the new `Permission::grants` (enforced in
  the auth layer, matched exhaustively — `Read ⊂ Trade ⊂ Admin`). The
  `auth_middleware` Axum layer resolves identity, enforces the **admission** rate
  limit, checks the revocation epoch, and gates the required `Permission`, rendering
  `401` / `403` / `429` through the #003 `VenueError` boundary; `GET /health` is
  fully exempt from **both** auth and rate limiting. The `RateLimiter` is a
  sliding-60 s window on the **injected venue clock** (`RateLimitClock`, bridged
  from the venue `FixedClock` — never `SystemTime`), keyed on `(account,
  revocation_epoch)` for an authenticated request (so a revoked-but-signed token
  cannot drain a fresh session's budget) with a peer-IP fallback, emitting
  `X-RateLimit-Limit` / `-Remaining` / `-Reset` (and `Retry-After` on `429`);
  decisions are replay-deterministic on the venue clock, with the `(session_id,
  arrival_sequence)` tie-break documented as the ingress-ordering seam. The
  limiter's key-space is bounded **by construction** by a `max_keys` ceiling
  (default `100_000`, a DoS control per [08 §5](docs/08-threat-model.md)): a
  would-be new key at capacity triggers an opportunistic inline sweep and, if
  still full, **fails closed** rather than grow — an attacker cycling source IPs
  cannot exhaust memory. Token
  issuance is gated by `BootstrapGate` (`AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_SECRET`, constant-time
  compare), and `JwtAuth::release_gated(DevMode)` refuses the embedded dev keys in
  a published image unless `--dev` / `FAUXCHANGE_DEV` is set (the image-scan test
  is #26). Secrets never leak: `JwtAuth` and `BootstrapGate` have redacting
  `Debug` impls. New dependency: `jsonwebtoken` 9 (`default-features = false,
  features = ["use_pem"]`), whose crypto backend `ring` 0.17 is already in the
  tree (no new crypto impl, no new major version); `tower` 0.5 (`util`, dev-only,
  already in-tree via axum) drives the middleware integration test. New tests:
  unit mint/verify (happy + tamper + expiry + `alg:none` + HS256 confusion),
  `has_permission` implication matrix, `/health` exemption, bootstrap-secret gate,
  dev-key release-gate refusal, revoked/unknown-account refusal, the rate-limiter
  sliding window + key independence + sweep + header rendering + venue-clock
  determinism, and secret-redaction assertions (`auth.rs`); the integration
  request flow through `auth_middleware` (missing token `401`, insufficient
  permission `403`, over-limit `429` with `X-RateLimit-*`, `/health` `200`), the
  `rate_limiter_window_bound` property (≤ N per 60 s window), and the
  replay-stable venue-clock decision test (`tests/auth.rs`). `src/auth.rs` only —
  the `AppState` wiring (registry account resolution) is #12.
- **`AppState`: the shared `Arc` wiring of the venue core and services** (#10) in
  `src/state.rs` — the application seam between the transport gateways and the
  domain ([02 §6, §8](docs/02-matching-architecture.md)). `AppState::new` takes an
  `AppStateConfig` (an explicit list of underlyings, since the config surface #22
  has not landed) and spawns **one single-writer actor per underlying**, wiring
  the real order path (`MatchingExecutor`) and post-journal fan-out (`StoreFanOut`,
  #8) into each — the order path and fan-out are live, not placeholder. A
  venue-wide `InstrumentRegistry` + `SymbolIndex` are created once and passed to
  every actor **by handle** (via the new
  `MatchingExecutor::new_with_registry_and_index` /
  `spawn_matching_actor_with_registry_and_index` in `src/exchange/executor.rs`,
  routing straight into the upstream `UnderlyingOrderBook::new_with_registry_and_index`
  verified public at the locked `option-chain-orderbook` 0.7.0), so cross-underlying
  lookups stay O(1) without coupling the writers (`BTC` and `ETH` sequence
  concurrently). The single shared executions / positions / mark stores are the
  **same `Arc` instances** each actor's `StoreFanOut` writes to and `AppState`
  exposes for reads. `AppState::submit` is the **only** path onto the sequenced
  order path: it routes a `VenueCommand` to the right underlying's actor (extracting
  the underlying via the upstream `SymbolParser` / the command's ticker) and awaits
  the `Receipt`, returning `VenueError::NotFound` for an unhosted underlying and
  `VenueError::InvalidOrder` for a venue-global command that carries no single
  routable underlying (broadcast/lifecycle routing lands with the control-plane
  issues). The auth / subscription-manager / market-maker / simulator services are
  stable-typed placeholders (`AuthPlaceholder` #11/#12, `SubscriptionsPlaceholder`
  #14, `MarketMakerPlaceholder` #15, `SimulatorPlaceholder` #16) that slot in
  without reshaping `AppState`. The shutdown path is dropping the last
  `Arc<AppState>`, which closes each bounded mailbox (draining its backlog) and ends
  the actor loop. Layering holds: `AppState` imports the domain, never
  `src/gateway/*`. Unit + integration (`tests/state.rs`) tests cover the spawned
  actor set, per-underlying routing, an unknown-underlying typed error, and an
  end-to-end submit whose crossing fill lands in the shared executions store
  `AppState` exposes.
- Book **snapshot + restore** over a consistent cut with a fresh journal epoch
  (#9) in `src/exchange/` (`snapshot.rs`, plus executor / stores / actor /
  journal wiring) — the operator escape hatch that is an **explicit replay
  exclusion**: it captures *state*, not the *sequence of decisions*, so a restore
  starts a new journal epoch rather than inject a book the journal never produced
  ([02 §9](docs/02-matching-architecture.md),
  [03 §10](docs/03-protocol-surfaces.md),
  [01 §6.1](docs/01-domain-model.md)). A `VenueSnapshot` is an atomic cut, as of
  one instant, of the **four** derived stores together — the leaf **books**
  (resting orders read back from the upstream book so a partially-filled maker
  carries its *current* quantity), the **executions** log, the **positions**
  fold, and the per-account **client-order-id idempotency map** — plus
  config/version `SnapshotMetadata`. Non-journaled analytics (mark price,
  unrealised P&L, Greeks, registry ids) are **excluded** and recompute live.
  `UnderlyingActor::capture` / `restore` are the entry points for the admin
  snapshot routes (#13) and the replay base-state hook (#30). A restore is
  **all-or-nothing**: metadata is validated first (a schema / lineage / config
  mismatch is refused with no mutation), the book rebuild is *prepared* (fallible,
  non-mutating) and the `SnapshotRestored` epoch marker journaled **before** any
  store is swapped, so a mid-restore fault rolls back all four; the commit is an
  infallible swap under actor quiescence (the "one PostgreSQL transaction" mode is
  the v0.3 durable seam). The marker opens a fresh epoch carrying the run
  `lineage_id` forward so id derivation continues in the same namespace, and the
  `underlying_sequence` **continues** from the last journaled value (it does
  **not** reset). Reproducibility is asserted **within** an epoch; the restore
  boundary is explicitly **out of scope** of the determinism oracle, not silently
  divergent.
- A `SnapshotRestored { snapshot_id, epoch, lineage_id }` epoch marker as a new
  `venue.v1` journal record (`JournalRecord::Epoch` / `RecordKind::Epoch`, #9),
  carrying the mandatory `schema` tag with the same `deny_unknown_fields`
  discipline and a committed golden; unlike a command/event pair it is **not**
  re-executable — recovery treats it as an epoch boundary.
- A per-account **client-order-id idempotency map** (`IdempotencyMap`, #9) owned
  by the single-writer executor and captured/restored as the fourth store of the
  cut ([01 §6.1](docs/01-domain-model.md)): a retry with a matching payload
  fingerprint returns the **stored terminal result** (no second order), and a
  conflicting reuse of the same key is rejected. It is a deterministic function of
  the journal, so a duplicate `ClOrdID`/client-id retried **after** a restore
  returns the stored result. (The full pre-journal dedup, cancel/replace
  `OrigClOrdID` correlation, and retention-window eviction are completed by the
  later FIX/idempotency issue.)
- In-memory executions + positions stores + the backend-agnostic store contract
  (#8) in `src/exchange/` (`stores.rs`) — the authoritative fill log and the
  per-`(account, symbol)` position fold, both derived from committed `VenueEvent`
  fills through the actor's post-journal `FanOut` seam #6 left open
  ([01 §7](docs/01-domain-model.md),
  [02 §6](docs/02-matching-architecture.md)). Adds `StoreFanOut`, the #8
  replacement for `NoopFanOut`: it runs **only after** a `VenueEvent` is
  journaled (step 5), projecting each committed fill **leg** into an
  authoritative `ExecutionRecord` and folding it into a `Position`, so the
  executions log stays a **deterministic function of the journal** (same journal
  → same executions). Both legs of one match are recorded (shared `execution_id`,
  distinct account / side / liquidity / fee — a maker rebate is negative), keyed
  `(execution_id, liquidity)` so the key stays unique even for a same-account
  self-trade. Positions fold with **exact integer-cents** accounting: `i128`
  checked accumulators (`checked_*`, never `saturating_*` / `wrapping_*`) give a
  signed `net_quantity`, a volume-weighted `avg_price`, and a `realized_pnl`, with
  the realized/unrealized split computed from one exact cost basis so
  `realized + unrealized == net_cash − fees + net_quantity × mark` holds
  **exactly** as an arithmetic identity — distinct from the ADR-0006 bounded
  replay oracle, and it even folds in the live mark (the truncated `avg_price`
  is never used in the P&L).
  `unrealized_pnl` is marked at **read time** against a `MarkSource` — the
  production `MarkPriceBook` wraps the upstream
  `option_chain_orderbook::MarkPriceCalculator` (verified present in the locked
  0.7.0) — and is a **live-only** projection: not journaled, not asserted across
  replays ([02 §5.5](docs/02-matching-architecture.md)); the read API takes the
  mark as an explicit argument to keep that boundary visible, and `delta_exposure`
  is `0.0` (Greeks not wired yet). The key deliverable is the backend-agnostic
  `ExecutionsStore` / `PositionsStore` **contract**: the in-memory
  `InMemoryExecutionsStore` / `InMemoryPositionsStore` here and the durable
  PostgreSQL stores (#23) implement the **same** traits, so the REST reads (#13)
  don't change when the backend swaps (the in-memory insertion order is a
  surrogate for the durable `SERIAL` id an SQL store would `ORDER BY`). The
  projected `ExecutionRecord` is the #4 wire DTO unchanged; without a pricer /
  latency injector wired in #8, `theo_value_cents` defaults to the fill price
  (so `edge_cents` is `0`) and `latency_us` is `0` — both documented live-only
  analytics per [01 §7](docs/01-domain-model.md) that later issues supply without
  a wire-shape change. New dependency: `dashmap` 6 (over `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<>>>`
  per `rules/global_rules.md` Concurrency), already resolved transitively via the
  upstream matching stack — no new tree version. New tests: unit executions
  both-leg insertion + account-scoped ordered listing, positions fold (signed
  net, volume-weighted avg, partial close, flip, both counterparties) and the
  upstream mark-book wiring (`stores.rs`); the
  `position_pnl_stays_consistent_across_fills` property (`tests/property.rs`); the
  `rest/execution_report.json` + `rest/positions.json` per-leg goldens
  (`tests/golden.rs`); and the orders → matching → stores integration, the
  store-projection-vs-golden assertions, and the executions-log determinism test
  through the public actor surface (`tests/stores.rs`).
- Real order path onto upstream matching (#7) in `src/exchange/`
  (`executor.rs`) — the `CommandExecutor` seam #6 left open, now driving the
  upstream `option-chain-orderbook` matching **unchanged** and capturing the
  lossless `VenueOutcome`
  ([02 §4–§5](docs/02-matching-architecture.md),
  [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-lossless-venue-envelope-outcomes.md)). Adds
  `MatchingExecutor`, which owns one per-underlying `UnderlyingOrderBook` and,
  per command, **vivifies the target leaf** through the hierarchy's idempotent
  `get_or_create_*` path (the same pure-function-of-the-symbol resolution the
  upstream `SequencedUnderlyingOrderBook` uses, so replay rebuilds identical
  structural state), drives the **account-preserving** `_full` leaf
  (`add_limit_order_with_tif_and_user_full` → `TradeResult`) for a limit
  `AddOrder`, and the **true non-resting market primitive**
  (`orderbook_rs::OrderBook::submit_market_order_with_user` via
  `OptionOrderBook::inner()`) for a market order — never a marketable-limit
  substitute, with an empty-book fast path that returns zero-fill / fully
  unfilled rather than an invented price. Captures every match as **two linked
  legs** (maker + taker sharing one `execution_id`, per-leg account / owner /
  fee) with the resting maker's identity recovered from the **journaled add
  command** via a deterministic registry, not live book state
  ([ADR-0009 §2](docs/adr/0009-lossless-venue-envelope-outcomes.md)). Captures
  fills on **both** paths: on `Ok` from the returned `TradeResult`, and on the
  **error-after-fills** `Err` path (an unfillable `Ioc` remainder, or an STP
  cancel after earlier fills) via a single-writer-safe **before/after diff** of
  the leaf's armed `last_trade_result()` capture slot (keyed on the strictly
  monotonic `engine_seq`; upstream Option-Chain-OrderBook#148: last-write-wins,
  no `take`/`clear`) — so a command that executed fills is **never** a bare
  `Rejected` ([ADR-0009 §1](docs/adr/0009-lossless-venue-envelope-outcomes.md)).
  Implements `CancelOrder` and the **non-atomic** `Replace` (cancel-then-add in
  one turn, one `VenueEvent` at one sequence, explicit `Replace { cancelled,
  add }` — no rollback if the add is rejected), and records STP-cancelled
  same-owner resting makers (`stp_cancelled`, sorted for a deterministic sweep
  order) recovered by an owner-scoped resting diff. Execution consults **no**
  wall-clock, RNG, or map-iteration order: the engine order id is assigned
  deterministically as `OrderId::sequential(underlying_sequence)` (the engine
  never RNG-mints a `Uuid` on the path), and the engine's process-local trade
  ids / wall-clock trade timestamps are excluded from the oracle
  ([02 §5](docs/02-matching-architecture.md)). Adds the `TopOfBook` read
  projection (the determinism oracle's read surface) and the ergonomic
  `spawn_matching_actor` wiring the real executor into the #6 actor (the
  `PlaceholderExecutor` stays for tests). Upstream methods verified against the
  **locked** `option-chain-orderbook` 0.7.0 (with transitive `orderbook-rs`
  0.10.5 / `pricelevel` 0.8.4); no new dependencies. New tests: unit
  add/cancel/replace/market happy paths + rejections, error-after-fill diff
  capture, empty-book + thin-book market, partial-replace (`cancelled: true`,
  add `Rejected`), STP affected-id recording, and per-leg fee capture
  (`executor.rs`); the `journal_replay_reconstructs_book` property
  (`tests/property.rs`); `market` / partial-`replace` outcome goldens extending
  the `venue.v1` set (`tests/golden.rs`); the seed → orders → matching →
  captured-fills integration round-trip and the **binding** determinism test
  (same journal → same fills + top-of-book) driven through the public actor /
  executor surface (`tests/order_path.rs`).
- Per-underlying single-writer actor + in-memory write-ahead envelope journal
  (#6) in `src/exchange/` (`actor.rs`, `journal.rs`) — the determinism
  foundation every book mutation flows through
  ([ADR-0006 §2–§3](docs/adr/0006-venue-command-envelope-and-single-writer-journal.md),
  [02 §4–§6, §8](docs/02-matching-architecture.md)). Adds the
  `UnderlyingActor` (one `tokio` task per underlying, the sole caller of the
  order path) with a **bounded** `mpsc` mailbox + `oneshot` receipts
  (`ActorHandle::submit` → `Receipt`; a full mailbox returns a typed
  `RateLimited` busy, never an unbounded queue), and its venue-owned
  `underlying_sequence` as a **`u64` checked counter** (advanced with
  `checked_add` per committed command — the upstream `OptionChainSequencer` is
  `pub(crate)`, so the venue owns numbering). Implements the write-ahead
  durability protocol per turn: append the `VenueCommand` envelope **before**
  executing (`N` advances only on a confirmed append; a confirmed pre-execution
  failure **reuses `N`** with the book untouched and no gap; an ambiguous result
  is resolved by an idempotent durable **tail read-back**), then execute +
  capture (the `CommandExecutor` seam, filled by #7), append the paired
  `VenueEvent`, and fan out (the `FanOut` seam, filled by #8) **only after** the
  event is journaled. A **post-mutation** event-append failure **seals** the
  underlying (no fan-out); a sequence **exhaustion** at `u64::MAX` seals with
  `SequenceExhausted`, never wraps. Adds `InMemoryVenueJournal` behind the
  `VenueJournal` trait (named to match the upstream `OptionChainJournal` shape —
  `append` / `read_from` / `last_sequence` — so the durable store swaps in at
  #29), the paired `JournalRecord` (`Command` / `Event`, keyed
  `(underlying, N, kind)` with idempotent re-append), and the deterministic
  `FixedClock` / `PlaceholderExecutor` / `NoopFanOut` #006 seam stubs. Extends
  the boundary `VenueError` with `SequenceExhausted` and `JournalUnavailable`
  (both redacted `500`/`internal`, non-retryable, non-terminal) and adds
  `JournalError` (`AppendFailed` / `Ambiguous` / `Conflict` / `Corruption`, the
  fixed durable/recovery contract). Enables the upstream
  `option-chain-orderbook` `sequencer` feature (activates upstream `tokio` +
  `orderbook-rs/journal`, pulling `memmap2` 0.9 into the tree — `crc32fast` was
  already present) to make the sequencer / mass-cancel types reachable for #7.
  The `memmap2` machinery is unused by #6 (which ships its own in-memory
  journal) and is flagged for the `cargo audit` / `cargo deny` gate (#19). New
  dependencies: `tokio` (`rt` + `sync` + `macros`; `rt-multi-thread` dev-only)
  for the actor runtime, and `tracing` for the actor's lifecycle / degraded-path
  logging — both already resolved transitively, adding no new tree version. New
  tests: unit single-writer ordering under concurrent submits, `checked_add`
  monotonicity, `SequenceExhausted` at `u64::MAX`, reuse-`N` + tail-read-back
  idempotency, and mailbox backpressure → busy (`actor.rs`); journal
  append/read/dedup/conflict units (`journal.rs`); `SequenceExhausted` /
  `JournalUnavailable` redaction units (`error.rs`); the
  `sequence_monotonic_per_symbol` property (`tests/property.rs`); and the
  integration actor round-trip + determinism fault-injection rows
  (pre-execution append fail → book untouched, reuse `N`; post-mutation append
  fail → seal, no fan-out) through the public seam surface (`tests/actor.rs`).
- Versioned `VenueCommand` / `VenueEvent` v1 envelope + lossless outcomes (#5)
  in `src/exchange/` (`envelope.rs`, `identity.rs`) — the venue's own internal
  instruction set, carrying the account/owner/TIF/order-type/STP identity the
  upstream `OptionChainCommand` drops **in** and the captured fills **out**,
  while invoking upstream matching unchanged
  ([ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-venue-command-envelope-and-single-writer-journal.md),
  [ADR-0009](docs/adr/0009-lossless-venue-envelope-outcomes.md)). Adds
  `VenueCommand` (`AddOrder` / `CancelOrder` / `Replace` / `MassCancel` /
  `SetInstrumentStatus` / `EvictExpiredOrders` and the control-plane
  `MarketMakerControl` / `Clock` / `SimStep`), the `VenueEvent`
  (`{ schema, underlying_sequence, venue_ts, command, outcome }`, mandatory
  `schema = "venue.v1"` tag), and the lossless `VenueOutcome` branches —
  `Added { fills, resting_quantity, stp_cancelled }`,
  `Market { fills, unfilled_quantity, stp_cancelled }` (the empty-book zero-fill
  case representable), `Replace { cancelled, add: AddOutcome
  (Filled { fills, stp_cancelled } / Rested { fills, resting_quantity,
  stp_cancelled } / Rejected) }` (explicitly non-atomic),
  `MassCancelled { affected: ordered Vec<CancelledLeg> }` (count derived),
  `Cancelled` / `InstrumentStatusChanged` / `Evicted` / `ControlApplied` /
  `Rejected { reason }`. Because a self-trade-prevention removal
  (`cancel_maker` / `cancel_both`) is a side-effect of a single add turn (one
  sequence, one event, no separate cancel command), the add-side outcomes carry
  a `stp_cancelled: Vec<CancelledLeg>` (`CancelReason::SelfTradePrevention`,
  empty when no STP fired) so the affected resting legs are recorded losslessly
  ([ADR-0009 §4](docs/adr/0009-lossless-venue-envelope-outcomes.md)); `Rejected`
  carries none because an STP removal is itself a book mutation. Models the
  **two linked legs per match** with the
  lossless internal `Fill` (adds the STP `owner: Hash32` and the seam `Side` to
  the #004 DTO `Fill`, sharing one `execution_id` across the maker + taker leg,
  each with its own account/side/liquidity/fee) and the venue-owned
  `CancelReason`. Adds the run `LineageId` with the deterministic composite-id
  grammar `"{lineage_id}:{underlying}:{underlying_sequence}:{index}"` for venue
  order ids and `execution_id`s (collision-free across runs and underlyings —
  `BTC:1 ≠ ETH:1`) and the `JournalHeader { schema_version, lineage_id }`.
  Re-exports the upstream `STPMode` at the boundary (available without the
  `sequencer` feature). Envelope serde pins `PascalCase` variant tags,
  `snake_case` fields, and `deny_unknown_fields`, and reuses the upstream seam
  newtypes (`Side` → `BUY`/`SELL`, `TimeInForce` → `GTC`, `Hash32` hex) with
  cents as integers. `MassCancelScope` / `MassCancelType` are owned venue-side
  mirrors of the upstream enums (which sit behind the `sequencer` feature that
  pulls the on-disk journal store #005 excludes), mapped 1:1 by the #006 actor.
  New tests: per-variant construction / serde units, id-grammar determinism +
  cross-underlying uniqueness + two-leg `execution_id` sharing, the
  `venue_envelope_serde_identity` and `venue_id_grammar_collision_free` property
  tests in `tests/property.rs`, and the `venue.v1` golden
  (`tests/golden/venue/add_order_event.json`) in `tests/golden.rs`. No new
  dependencies.

- REST/WS DTO layer (#4) in `src/models.rs`: the venue value objects and their
  `serde` + `utoipa::ToSchema` projection onto the wire, prices in integer cents
  and timestamps in venue-clock milliseconds. Covers the whole inherited Backend
  route surface — order entry (`PlaceLimitOrderRequest` / `PlaceMarketOrderRequest`
  + responses), bulk/cancel-all, price get/set, hierarchy CRUD views
  (`InstrumentView`, quotes, underlying/expiration/strike summaries), the
  account-scoped `ExecutionRecord` and the distinct public-anonymised WS `fill`
  print (no `account`/`fee`; the four join keys `execution_id` /
  `underlying_sequence` / `venue_ts` / `liquidity`), positions, controls, chain /
  volatility-surface, greeks / metrics, OHLC, auth token, and admin
  snapshot req/resp. Adds the value objects `Order` / `Fill` / `Position` /
  `Account`, the wire enums with pinned casing (`Permission` / `Side` /
  `OptionStyle` / `OrderStatus` lowercase, `TimeInForce` `UPPERCASE`,
  `OrderType` / `LiquidityFlag` `snake_case`), the opaque identity newtypes
  (`AccountId` / `ClientOrderId` / `VenueOrderId` / `ExecutionId`), and the
  `WsMessage` protocol (`#[serde(tag = "type", content = "data")]`, all
  server→client variants), whose `error` variant reuses the #003 `WsError`
  envelope verbatim. Money fields are only `Cents` / `SignedCents` newtypes (the
  sole floats are documented analytics — Greeks/IV/VWAP/impact); every request
  DTO carries `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`; and `validate_order_shape`
  enforces the boundary order rules (Limit⇒price, Market⇒none, quantity>0,
  price>0) as a typed `VenueError`. Adds `ToSchema` to the #003 `ErrorEnvelope`
  / `WsError` / `WsErrorCode` / `WsErrorCategory` (architect finding B) and the
  `utoipa` 5 dependency (already resolved transitively — no new tree version).
  New tests: co-located validation + casing + `deny_unknown_fields` units,
  the `order_dto_serde_identity` / `ws_message_serde_identity` property tests in
  `tests/property.rs`, and per-DTO / per-`WsMessage`-variant wire goldens under
  `tests/golden/{rest,ws}/` (asserting integer cents and the `type` discriminant,
  with an `UPDATE_GOLDEN` regeneration mode) in `tests/golden.rs`.

- Typed error boundary (#3) in `src/error.rs`: the closed-set `VenueError`
  (`NotFound` / `InvalidOrder` / `Unauthorized` / `Forbidden(Permission)` /
  `RateLimited` / `Overflow` / `Upstream(#[from] option_chain_orderbook::Error)`)
  with three renderings of one failure. `IntoResponse` maps each variant to
  exactly one HTTP status (404/400/401/403/429/500) via an exhaustive match,
  emits a typed `ErrorEnvelope` JSON body (never `serde_json::Value`), and
  attaches `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-Remaining` context on 429. The FIX
  reject **seam** (`FixRejectContext` → `FixReject` with `FixRejectKind` /
  `FixRejectReason`) selects `ExecutionReport (8) Rejected` / `OrderCancelReject
  (9)` / `MarketDataRequestReject (Y)` / `BusinessMessageReject (j)` / `Reject
  (3)` **by inbound message context** and the reason category **by the error**,
  per the authoritative `docs/03 §8` matrix — types and a pure mapping only, no
  wire encoding (that lands with the acceptor, #039). The versioned WebSocket
  envelope (`WsError`, schema `ws-error.v1`) maps every variant to a stable
  `(code, category)` with `terminal` / `retryable` / `retry_after_ms`
  (`Unauthorized` terminal, command errors non-terminal). Internal / `Overflow`
  / `Upstream` details are redacted on the HTTP body, the FIX `Text (58)`, and
  the WS message; the `#002` `MoneyError` / `SymbolError` fold into `VenueError`
  via `From`. Adds `Permission { Read, Trade, Admin }` (lowercase wire) in
  `src/models.rs` — the canonical home per `docs/01 §8` — and the `axum` 0.8
  dependency (lean, `json`-only feature set) for `IntoResponse`. Error-envelope
  goldens under `tests/golden/{rest,ws}/` with shape tests in `tests/golden.rs`.

- Domain boundary newtypes, integer-cents money, and the symbol grammar (#2)
  in `src/exchange/`: the `Cents` / `SignedCents` / `Notional` money newtypes
  (private fields, validated constructors, checked arithmetic returning a typed
  `MoneyError`, bare-integer wire via `#[serde(transparent)]`); re-exports of
  the upstream boundary newtypes (`OrderId`, `Side`, `Price`, `Quantity`,
  `TimeInForce`, `OptionStyle`, `ExpirationDate`, `TimestampMs`, `Hash32`,
  `InstrumentStatus`) so the venue names them without redefinition; the
  venue-owned `EventTimestamp` and `SequenceNumber`; a `Symbol` newtype routed
  through the upstream `SymbolParser` with the `validate_venue_expiry`
  invariant (`ExpirationDate::Days` refused, non-canonical `23:59:59 UTC`
  instant rejected as an aliasing error); and the `Instrument` value object.
  Adds the `option-chain-orderbook`, `optionstratlib`, `serde`, and `thiserror`
  dependencies (plus `proptest` / `serde_json` dev-deps) and property tests
  (`cents_never_lossy`, `symbol_roundtrip`) in `tests/property.rs`.

- Crate skeleton (#1): the canonical module tree from
  `docs/00-design-bootstrap.md` §6 as empty, `//!`-documented stubs —
  `config`, `error`, `models`, `state`, `gateway/{rest,ws,fix}`,
  `exchange`, `market_maker`, `simulation`, `microstructure`, `ohlc`,
  `db`, `auth` — plus `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, crate-level docs in
  `src/lib.rs` (`error`/`models` re-exported at the crate root), a
  commented bootstrap outline in `src/main.rs`, and the empty
  `tests/`, `benches/`, `migrations/`, `docker/` directories. No venue
  behavior yet — every module is an empty stub so later issues add code
  into a tree that already compiles.
